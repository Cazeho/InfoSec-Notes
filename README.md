Personal notes used as a way to keep trace of my experimentations over the
years on attack vectors and digital forensics.

The repository behind the notes can be found at:
[`https://github.com/Qazeer/InfoSec-Notes`](https://github.com/Qazeer/InfoSec-Notes).

{% hint style="warning" %}
* These notes are distributed in the hope that they will be useful, but without warranty of any kind.
* Some notes are work in progress and quality of each note may greatly vary (notably depending on the time spent on the note).
* Some content may be outdated as the first note was written over 4 years ago and tradecraft has evolved since.
