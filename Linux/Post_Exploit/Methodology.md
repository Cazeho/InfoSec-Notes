# Linux - Post-Exploit

### SSH keys exfiltration

The metasploit module post/multi/gather/ssh_creds will collect the contents of
all users' .ssh directories on the targeted machine. Additionally,
known_hosts and authorized_keys and any other files are also downloaded.

```
msf > use post/multi/gather/ssh_creds
```

Lateral movement through SSH brute force is possible using private SSH keys,
refer to the [L7] SSH note.
