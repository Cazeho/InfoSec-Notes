Web Application - Authentication
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Authentication lies at the heart of an application’s protection against
malicious attack. It is the front line of defense against unauthorized access.  

Without robust authentication to rely on, none of the other core security
mechanisms (such as session management and access control) can be effective.

In the typical case, a user supplies her username and password, and the
application must verify that these items are correct. If so, it lets the user
in. If not, it does not.

### identify authentication functionalities

Locate all the authentication-related functionalities where credentials are
supplied:
- Login
- Account registration
- Login and password recovery
- Password confirmation



### Account registration

If possible register an account on the web application. An account is needed in
order to determine precisely if the application implements any brute force
protection mechanisms.

### Password policy

Upon registration, the password policy enforced by the web application can be
reviewed. This review must be extended to the password change functionality if
present on the web application.

If available, assessed the application description of the minimum quality rules
enforced on user passwords and try to establish the rules actually enforced.

Try:
- Short passwords (1 to 6 characters)
- Alphabetic lowercase/Alphabetic uppercase/numeric/symbol characters only
- Current username/web application name

Establish the range of values that a password guessing attack would need to
employ to have a good probability of success.  

Note: For long term use, the password policy should enforce:
- Length > 8 characters.
- Must not contains the username or part of the username.
- Use at least three of the four available characters types: lowercase,
uppercase, numbers and symbols.

### Username enumeration

If self account registration is possible on the web application, username
enumeration would *de facto* be possible and considered a required feature.
However, being able to enumerate

For each authentication functions found, submit two requests, containing a
valid and an invalid username.
Review every detail and observe any differences of the server’s responses to
each pair of requests, including:
- HTTP status code
- Information displayed on-screen
- Any redirects
- Any differences hidden in the HTML page source
- Byte response size as given by BurpSuite

If the application respond differently, username is possible.

Finally, check for any other sources of information leakage within the
application that may enable you to compile a list of valid usernames.
Examples are actual listings of registered users, direct mention of names or
e-mail addresses in source code comments, etc.

### Brute force protection mechanisms

If a captcha mechanisms is used by the application, look out for way to
automate its guessing. If the captcha validation can't be automated, the
authentication is secure to brute force attack.

In the absence of a captache mechanisms, or if the captcha validation can be
automated, futher research must be
