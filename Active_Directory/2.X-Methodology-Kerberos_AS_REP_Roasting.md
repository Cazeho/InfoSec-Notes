# Active Directory - AS_REP roasting

### Overview

An ASP_REP roasting attack is an attack on the `Kerberos` authentication
protocol that involves compromising the password of an user account that do not
require `Kerberos` pre-authentication.

The attack is based on the fact that the `KRB_AS_REP` response, in reply from
the `KDC (Key Distribution Center)` for an initial authentication request
`KRB_AS_REQ` to the `Authentication Service (AS)`, contains ciphertext
encrypted using the client's secret key.

By default, the `KRB_AS_REQ` must include a timestamp encrypted with the
client's secret key, in order to permit the verification of the user identity
before the `KDC` returns a `KRB_AS_REP` response. This verification is omitted
for user accounts that do not require `Kerberos` pre-authentication, i.e
accounts with the account property `DONT_REQ_PREAUTH`. These user accounts
secrets are exposed to offline cracking, against the ciphertext, attack that
are much faster and can not be time restricted.

### Automated DONT_REQ_PREAUTH user accounts discovery and export of AS-REP responses

The following tools can be used to automate the discovery of user accounts that
do not require `Kerberos` pre-authentication and the request and export of
`KRB_AS_REQ` response for offline cracking:

```
Rubeus.exe asreproast /format:hashcat /outfile:<FILE>
```

### DONT_REQ_PREAUTH user accounts discovery

The following tools can be used to discover user accounts that do not require
`Kerberos` pre-authentication:

```
```

### Request and export of KRB_AS_REP responses

The following tools can be used to request and export `KRB_AS_REP` for user
accounts that do not require `Kerberos` pre-authentication:

```
```

### Offline cracking of KRB_AS_REP responses

Both `John the Ripper` (magnumripper fork) and `hashcat` can be used to crack
the KRB_AS_REP responses.

The hash needs to respect the following format to be recognized by `John` /
`hashcat`:

```
```
