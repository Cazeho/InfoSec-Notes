### Credentials dumping

Credential dumping is the process of obtaining account login and password
information, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password, from
the operating system. The Windows operating system stores user accounts
information in the `Security Account Manager (SAM)` hive or the
`Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSASS)` process, for local or domain
accounts respectively.

For techniques and tools to efficiently dump credentials on a Windows host,
refer to the `[Windows] Post Exploit` note.
