# Active_Directory - Kerberos Silver Tickets

### Overview

`Service tickets` are generated by the `Ticket-Granting Service (TGS)` of the
`Key Distribution Center (KDC)` and used by clients to access domain ressources
exposed through service accounts, i.e user accounts that have a
`ServicePrincipalName (SPN)` configured.

`Service tickets` are generated by the `TGS` upon reception of a valid
`Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT)` using:
  - one of the secrets (`RC4 key`, whose value is identical to the `NTLM` hash,
    or `AES 128/256 bits keys`) of the `krbtgt` account (`KDC Signature`)
  - one of the secrets of the targeted service account (`Server Signature` and
    encryption of the `TGS`).

However, as the service account has no knowledge of the the `krbtgt` account's
secrets, no verification is done by default on the `KDC Signature` signature
upon receipt and verification of the validity of a `service ticket`. Thus, in
the majority of environment, only the knowledge of one of the secrets of the
service account is necessary for the generation of valid `service tickets` for
the service (and renewals of the `krbtgt`'s password do not invalidate the
crafted `service tickets`).

Note that the `Kerberos PAC Validation` mechanism can be enabled on a service
to enforce a systematic verification of the `service tickets`'s
`Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC)` `KDC Signature` signature with a
request to the `KDC`. As the additional verification induced by the mechanism
requires an exchange between the server hosting the service and the `KDC`, its
activation can cause significant performance losses.
