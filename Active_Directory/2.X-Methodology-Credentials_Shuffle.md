# Active Directory - Credential Shuffle

### Overview

###### BloodHound

BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended
relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use
BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise
be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use BloodHound to identify and
eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and red teams can use BloodHound
to easily gain a deeper understanding of privilege relationships in an
Active Directory environment.

### Exploit

#### Locally use credentials

Set the main DNS server on the attacking computer to the Domain Controller IP
address:

```
Control Pannel -> Network and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center -> Change adapter setting -> right click on the adapter being used -> Properties -> Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) -> Properties -> Set the Preferred DNS server field  
```

To authenticate locally as another user (with plaintext credentials) and
execute Powershell commands use:

```
# runas
runas /NetOnly /user:<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME> powershell.exe

# For the commands supporting PSCredential
$secpasswd = ConvertTo-SecureString "<PASSWORD>" -AsPlainText -Force
$creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME>", $secpasswd)
```
