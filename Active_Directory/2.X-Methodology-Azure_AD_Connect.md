# Active Directory - Azure Active Directory Connect

### Overview

`Azure Active Directory (AD) Connect` is a Microsoft utility used to
connect on-premises Active Directory forests with Azure AD. Using `Azure AD
Connect`, on premise users can access cloud-based services in an hybrid
identity model across (Windows Server) Active Directory and Azure AD.

During `Azure AD Connect` installation, an user account is created in the
on-premise Active Directory forest: the `Azure Active Directory Domain Services
(AD DS) Connector account`. The account is by default named `MSOL_<HEX_ID>`
(for example: `MSOL_a8a17814304d`). Additionally, an Azure AD user is also
automatically created (named
`Sync_<AAD_CONNECT_SERVER_HOSTNAME>_<HEX_ID>@<AZURE_TENANT>`, with a matching
`<HEX_ID>`).  

###### Synchronization modes - Password Hash Sync vs Pass-through Authentication

`Azure AD Connect` currently implements two synchronization modes / sign-in
methods:
  - `Password Hash Sync (PHS)`, in which on-premises Active Directory users'
    NTLM password hashes (NTLM hashes and Kerberos keys) are extracted and
    synchronized from the on-premises Active Directory forest to Azure AD.

  - `Pass-through Authentication (PTA)`, in which on-premises Active Directory
    users' passwords are not synchronized with Azure AD. The Azure AD
    authentication request are instead directly sent to the on-premises
    Active Directory instance.

In a `Password Hash Sync` setup, the `Azure AD DS Connector account` is granted
replication privileges (`Replicate Directory Changes` and `Replicate Directory
Changes All`) in the Active Directory forest in order to be able to extract the
users' password hashes.

###### Active Directory Federation Services alternative

While `Azure AD Connect` is sufficient for connecting an on-premise Active
Directory environment with Azure AD, `Active Directory Federation Services` may
be used as well. `ADFS` is an utility developed by Microsoft to provide single
sign-on access to external resources and that implements a claims-based
access-control authorization model. `ADFS` establishes a trust between two
federation servers: one client-side and another resources-side. On the
client-side, `ADFS` connects to the on-premise `Active Directory Domain
Services` to authenticates users using the Active Directory database and issues
a token that can be transmitted to the resources-side federation server.
`ADFS` presents the advantage of enabling federation with various compliant
federation services (such as `Software as a Service (SaaS)` applications,
`ADFS` servers from external Active Directory forests, etc.) but
is however much more difficult to deploy and administrate than `Azure AD
Connect`.

### Azure AD Connect identification

The following PowerShell commands, that rely on cmdlets from the Microsoft
`Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)` utilities, can be used to identity
the `Azure AD DS Connector account` and whether the account is granted
replication privileges or not.

```
Get-ADUser -Filter "name -like 'MSOL_*'"
Get-ADUser -Properties Description -Filter "Description -like '*Azure*'"

# Checks if the Azure AD DS Connector account is granted replication privileges.
# FOREST_ROOT_OBJECT = "DC=LAB,DC=AD" for example
Get-ACL -Path "AD:<FOREST_ROOT_OBJECT>" | Select -ExpandProperty Access | ? IdentityReference -match "
MSOL_*" | ? ObjectType -match '1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2|1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2'
```

### Initial compromise of the Azure AD Connect server

The compromise of the `Azure AD Connect` server is a prerequisite of the
attacks introduced below. The `Azure AD Connect` server may benefit from a
lower security level than the Domain Controllers usually identified as critical
infrastructure resources.

The initial compromise of the `Azure AD Connect` server can be achieved in a
number of ways (out of the scope of the present note):

| Description | Related note(s) |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Compromise of an account that can (remotely or using a local connection) execute OS commands through the `Azure AD Connect` server `MSSQL` database. | `[ActiveDirectory] - 1433 MSSQL` note. |
| Remote code execution vulnerability or compromise of a service allowing for remote code execution on an exposed service. | `L7` notes. |
| Compromise of mutualized local Administrators accounts or domain accounts member of the local `Administrators` group. | `[ActiveDirectory] - Credentials_theft_shuffling` note. |
| Exploitable `ACL` (`GenericAll`, `WriteOwner`, `WriteDACL`, etc.) defined on the `Azure AD Connect` server's machine account. | `[ActiveDirectory] ACL exploiting - Computer machine account ACL exploitation` note. |
| Code execution through `Group Policy Objects (GPO)` linked to the `Azure AD Connect` server (through exploitable `ACL` on the `GPO` or `GPO` files). | `[ActiveDirectory] ACL exploiting - GPO ACEs exploitation` note. |
| Prior compromise of an account trusted for Kerberos delegations on the `Azure AD Connect` server. | `[ActiveDirectory] - Kerberos delegations` note. |
| ... | ... |

### Password Hash Synchronization exploit

After achieving command execution in an elevated context on the `Azure AD
Connect` server, the `Azure AD DS Connector account` cleartext password can be
retrieved in a number of ways:
  - by dumping and extracting the authentication secrets stored in the `LSASS`
    process. This technique is usually more closely defended against by
    `Endpoint detection and response (EDR)` products than the other one
    presented below. Refer to the `[Windows] Post exploitation - Credentials
    dumping` note for more information on how to dump credentials from `LSASS`
    as stealthy as possible.

  - by retrieving the `Azure AD DS Connector account` encrypted password from
    the `MSSQL` `ADSync` database (`encrypted_configuration` column of the
    `mms_management_agent` table) and decrypting it using functions implemented
    in the `Microsoft Azure AD Sync\Bin\mcrypt.dll` `DLL`.

    On out of date `Azure AD Connect` servers installed before early 2020, the
    decryption key can be simply retrieved with sufficient privileges using
    functions from the `mcrypt.dll` `DLL`.  

    Since an update changing the way the decryption key is handled, it is now
    necessary to execute code in the context of the `NT SERVICE\ADSync` Virtual
    Account to access the decryption key stored as a `DPAPI` key. This can be
    achieved in two notable ways:
      - By injecting in a process running as the `NT SERVICE\ADSync` account
        and using the previous technique. This can be done using various tools
        such as `metasploit`'s `meterpreter` or in a `Cobalt Strike` beacon.
      - By executing operating system commands through the `MSSQL` service
        (using `xp_cmdshell` for instance), which run under the security
        context of the `NT SERVICE\ADSync` account.

###### Against outdated Azure AD Connect installations

Multiple tools may be used to conduct the extraction and decryption process
against outdated Azure AD Connect installations:

  - The [AdSyncDecrypt](https://github.com/VbScrub/AdSyncDecrypt/releases)
    VB.NET tool.

    The `AdDecrypt.exe` binary must be executed:
      - in a folder with the `mcrypt.dll` `DLL` present.
      - with the AD Sync binary folder as the working directory or with the
        folder added to the PATH environment variable.

    ```
    # Default location of the AD Sync binary folder
    cd "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Sync\Bin"

    # Against the default SQLExpress “LocalDb” instance.
    <PATH>\AdDecrypt.exe

    # Against a full MSSQL instance
    <PATH>\AdDecrypt.exe -FullSQL
    ```

  - [adconnectdump](https://github.com/fox-it/adconnectdump), which is
    composed of the `ADSyncDecrypt`, `ADSyncGather`, and `ADSyncQuery` C#
    utilities as well as the `adconnectdump.py` Python script.

    `ADSyncDecrypt` and `ADSyncGather` work similarly to `AdDecrypt.exe` and
    require code execution on the targeted `Azure AD Connect` server.  
    `ADSyncQuery` present the advantage of conducting the extraction through
    remote `RPC` calls. It however requires a local `MSSQL` instance to be
    installed on the attacking computer.

    ```
    # The ADSyncQuery.exe sould be present in the directory.
    python.exe adconnectdump.py [[<DOMAIN>/]<USERNAME>@<HOSTNAME | IP>
    ```
