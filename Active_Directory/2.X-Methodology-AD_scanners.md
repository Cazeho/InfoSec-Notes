# Active Directory - Automatic scanners

### BloodHound

`BloodHound` uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended
relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use
`BloodHound` to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would
otherwise be impossible to quickly identify.

The official installation procedure is available on the GitHub repository:
`https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/wiki/Getting-started`

###### SharpHound

`SharpHound` is a C# data ingestor used by `BloodHound` to enumerate the Active
Directory targeted domain. A PowerShell script `SharpHound.ps1`, in-lining the
C# DLL, is available as well.

By default, `SharpHound` will output multiples JSON files in a compressed Zip
file that can directly be imported for graphical review and query in
`BloodHound`.

Multiples collection methods can be used:

| CollectionMethod | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Default | Performs group membership collection, domain trust collection, local admin collection, and session collection |
| Group | Performs group membership collection |
| LocalAdmin | Performs local admin collection |
| RDP | Performs Remote Desktop Users collection |
| DCOM | Performs Distributed COM Users collection |
| GPOLocalGroup | Performs local admin collection using Group Policy Objects |
| Session | Performs session collection |
| ComputerOnly | Performs local admin, RDP, DCOM and session collection |
| LoggedOn | Performs privileged session collection (requires admin rights on target systems) |
| Trusts | Performs domain trust enumeration |
| ACL | Performs collection of ACLs |
| Container | Performs collection of Containers |
| DcOnly | Performs collection using LDAP only. Includes Group, Trusts, ACL, ObjectProps, Container, and GPOLocalGroup |
| All | Performs all Collection Methods except GPOLocalGroup and LoggedOn |

Usage:

```
Import-Module SharpHound.ps1
Invoke-Bloodhound -Verbose -Domain '<DOMAIN>' -DomainController '<DC>' -LDAPUser '<USERNAME>' -LDAPPass '<PASSWORD>' -CollectionMethod  all

SharpHound.exe -v --Domain '<DOMAIN>' --DomainController '<DC>' --LDAPUser '<USERNAME>' --LDAPPass '<PASSWORD>' --CollectionMethod  all
```

###### BloodHound GUI

The following commands can be used to start `BloodHound`. The default neo4j
credentials are `neo4j:neo4j` and must be changed for the first login.

```
# Windows
net start neo4j
.\BloodHound.exe

# Linux
neo4j start
bloodhound
```

The zip files produced by `SharpHound` can simply be drag and dropped in the
`BloodHound` graphical interface for treatment. The `Upload` button on the
right may be used as well.

###### [Linux] BloodHound Owned

The `bh-owned.rb` ruby script can be used to automatically tag the provided
users from a file as owned or blacklist.

```
ruby bh-owned.rb -u neo4j -p <NEO4J_DB_PASSWORD> -a <COMPROMISED_USERS_FILE>
```

Note that the usernames must correspond to the `BloodHound` expected node
format: `UPPERCASE_USERNAME@UPPERCASE_DOMAIN_FQDN`.

```
$users_file=<USERNAMES_FILE>
$users_fqdn=<UPPERCASE_DOMAIN_FQDN>

touch ./tmp_file
cat $users_file | while read line; do
  echo $line"@"$users_fqdn >> ./tmp_file
done

awk '{print toupper($0)}' < ./tmp_file > formated_users_file.txt
rm -rf ./tmp_file

ruby bh-owned.rb -u neo4j -p <NEO4J_DB_PASSWORD> -a <COMPROMISED_USERS_FILE>
```

### PingCastle

`PingCastle` is an C# application designed to run a number of security checks,
targeting the most common Active Directory security issues.    

Note that the licensing model of `PingCastle` specify the following:
  - "Except if a license is purchased, you are not allowed to make any profit
  from this source code"
  - "It is allowed to run PingCastle without purchasing any license on for
  profit companies if the company itself (or its ITSM provider) run it"

So in order to legally make use of `PingCastle`, a license must be purchased or
the scans must be conducted by the audited company and the results communicated
to the auditors.

`PingCastle` can be launched using the current user security context or with
a specified account using:

```
PingCastle.exe --server <DC_FQDN | DC_IP> --user "<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME>" --password "<PASSWORD>" --interactive
```

The `healthcheck` mode runs more that fifty checks, including:
  - enumeration of the operating systems in use
  - enumeration of Active Directory privileges group memberships and
  users with the admincount bit set to 1 (AdminSdHolder)
  - verification of privileges security principals' and GPO's ACLs
  - presence of GPP passwords and restricted groups definition in GPO
  - implementation of LAPS and Windows Event Forwarding
  - security principals that can have an empty password or vulnerable to
  Kerberoast or ASP-Roast
  - enumeration of trusts
  - verification if the `Exchange Windows Permissions` security principal has
  the `WriteDacl` right in the root domain security descriptor
  - etc.

Note that before running the `healthcheck`, the limitation of 100 users in the
generated HTML report can be deleted: `6-advanced -> 4-noenumlimit`.

The `permissions` mode runs a number of group memberships, GPO mapping and ACL
checks to create an Active Directory compromission graph, similar to what can
be accomplished through `BloodHound`. In the generated
`Active Directory compromission Graph`, a graph can be visualized in the
`Detailed analysis` section by clicking on the `Analysis` link.

`PingCastle` can also be used to run a number of specific security scans:

| Scan | Description |
|------|-------------|
| aclcheck | Check authorization related to users or groups. Default to everyone, authenticated users and domain users. |
| antivirus | Check for computers without known antivirus installed. It is used to detect unprotected computers but may also report computers with unknown antivirus. |
| laps_bitlocker | Check on the AD if LAPS and/or BitLocker has been enabled. Default check for all the computers in the domain. |
| localadmin | Enumerate the local Administrators of the specified computer or all computers in the domain. |
| nullsession | Check if null sessions are enabled. |
| share | List all shares published on the specified computer or all computers in the domain and determine if the share can be accessed by anyone. |
| smb | Scan the specified computer or all computers in the domain and determine the smb version available. Also check if SMB signing is enabled. |
| spooler | Check if the spooler service is remotely active on the specified computer or all computers in the domain. |
| startup | Get the last startup date of the specified computer or all computers in the domain. Can be used to determine if latest patches have been applied. |
