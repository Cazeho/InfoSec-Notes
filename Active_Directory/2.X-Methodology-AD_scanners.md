# Active Directory - Automatic scanners

### BloodHound

`BloodHound` uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended
relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use
`BloodHound` to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would
otherwise be impossible to quickly identify.

The official installation procedure is available on the GitHub repository:
`https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/wiki/Getting-started`

###### SharpHound

`SharpHound` is a C# data ingestor used by `BloodHound` to enumerate the Active
Directory targeted domain. A PowerShell script `SharpHound.ps1`, in-lining the
C# DLL, is available as well.

By default, `SharpHound` will output multiples JSON files in a compressed Zip
file that can directly be imported for graphical review and query in
`BloodHound`.

Multiples collection methods can be used:

| CollectionMethod | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Default | Performs group membership collection, domain trust collection, local admin collection, and session collection |
| Group | Performs group membership collection |
| LocalAdmin | Performs local admin collection |
| RDP | Performs Remote Desktop Users collection |
| DCOM | Performs Distributed COM Users collection |
| GPOLocalGroup | Performs local admin collection using Group Policy Objects |
| Session | Performs session collection |
| ComputerOnly | Performs local admin, RDP, DCOM and session collection |
| LoggedOn | Performs privileged session collection (requires admin rights on target systems) |
| Trusts | Performs domain trust enumeration |
| ACL | Performs collection of ACLs |
| Container | Performs collection of Containers |
| DcOnly | Performs collection using LDAP only. Includes Group, Trusts, ACL, ObjectProps, Container, and GPOLocalGroup |
| All | Performs all Collection Methods except GPOLocalGroup and LoggedOn |

Usage:

```
Import-Module SharpHound.ps1
Invoke-Bloodhound -Verbose -Domain '<DOMAIN>' -DomainController '<DC>' -LDAPUser '<USERNAME>' -LDAPPass '<PASSWORD>' -CollectionMethod  all

SharpHound.exe -v --Domain '<DOMAIN>' --DomainController '<DC>' --LDAPUser '<USERNAME>' --LDAPPass '<PASSWORD>' --CollectionMethod  all
```

###### BloodHound GUI

The following commands can be used to start `BloodHound`. The default neo4j
credentials are `neo4j:neo4j` and must be changed for the first login.

```
net start neo4j
.\BloodHound.exe
```

The zip files produced by `SharpHound` can simply be drag and dropped in the
`BloodHound` graphical interface for treatment. The `Upload` button on the
right may be used as well.
