# FTP - Overview

The **File Transfer Protocol** (FTP) is the standard network protocol used for the
**transfer of computer files between a client and server** on a computer network.

FTP operates in the **Application Layer (L7)** of the Internet Protocol Suite
of the OSI model.

FTP is built on a **client-server model architecture** and uses separate control
and data connections between the client and the server.

FTP **users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol**,
normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if
the server is configured to allow it.

For **secure transmission** that protects the username and password, and encrypts
the content, FTP is often secured with **SSL/TLS (FTPS)**.
SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is sometimes also used instead;
it is technologically different.
