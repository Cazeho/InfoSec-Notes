# DNS - Overview

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for
computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private
network.  

It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the
participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized
domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying
computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.  

By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System
has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.
