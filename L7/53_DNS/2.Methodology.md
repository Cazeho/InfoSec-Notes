# DNS - Methodology

### Authority domain servers

To retrieve the DNS servers having authority over a specific domain, the
following command be used:

```
host -t ns <DOMAIN>
dig -t NS +short <DOMAIN>
```

### DNS lookup

To resolve the IP associated to a Domain/Fully Qualified Domain Name:

```
dig +short <FQDN>
host <DOMAIN/FQDN>
```

The following commands can be used to retrieve specific DNS records associated
with a domain:

```
# Relies on ANY, which is often blocked or filtered, to query all records
dig +nocmd +noall +answer <target_domain> ANY

# A/AAAA/NS/SOA/MX/TXT
dig +nocmd +noall +answer <DOMAIN> <RECORDTYPE>
```

### Reverse DNS lookup

To resolve the Domain/Fully Qualified Domain Name associated to an IP address:

```
dig +short -x <IP>
dig +short @<NAMESERVER> -x <IP>
host <IP>
host <IP> <NAMESERVER>
nmap -sn -Pn --dns-servers <NAMESERVER> (<IP> | <FQDN> | <CIDR> | <RANGE>)
```

### DNS zone transfers

A zone transfer is similar to a database replication act between related DNS
servers. This process includes the copying of the zone file from a master DNS
server to a slave server.  
Zone transfers should usually be limited to authorized slave DNS servers (by IP
source or protected by a TSIG key) but a misconfigured DNS server could be
allowing zone transfer from anyone.

The following commands can be used to test for zone transfers:

```
dig -t AXFR @<NAMESERVER> <DOMAIN>
host -l <DOMAIN> <NAMESERVER>
```

The DNSRecon and DNSenum tools can be used to enumerate nameservers for a domain and try a
zone transfer for each enumerated nameserver:

```
dnsrecon -a -d <DOMAIN>
dnsrecon -a -n <NAMESERVER> -d <DOMAIN>

dnsenum <DOMAIN>
dnsenum --dnsserver <NAMESERVER> <DOMAIN>
```

### DNS zone walking

Due to a design flaw in the NSEC records used by DNSSEC, it may be possible to
discover all subdomains of a particular domain for which NSEC records are
available.

The DNSRecon tool can be used to conduct DNS zone walking:

```
dnsrecon -t zonewalk -d <DOMAIN>
```

### Forward lookup brute force

Forward lookup brute force consist of guessing valid names, from a wordlist, of
servers by attempting to resolve a given name.   
If the guessed name does resolve, the results might indicate the presence and
even functionality of the server.

The following wordlists of subdomains can be used:

```
# bitquark - Top 1000 to 1000000
https://github.com/bitquark/dnspop/tree/master/results

# dnsscan - Top 100 to 10000
https://github.com/rbsec/dnscan

# SecList - 2178752 entries
SecLists/Discovery/DNS/jhaddix-dns.txt
```

The following tools can be used to conduct automated forward lookup brute force:

```
# Subbrute
python subbrute.py -v <DOMAIN>
python subbrute.py -v -s <WORDLIST> -c <THREADS> <DOMAIN>

# echo "<NAMESERVER>" > tmp_resolver.txt
python subbrute.py -v -r tmp_resolver.txt -s <WORDLIST> -c <THREADS> <DOMAIN>

# Gobuster
gobuster -m dns -w <WORDLIST> -t <THREADS> -i -u <DOMAIN>

dnscan / Nmap / Recon-Ng / DNSRecon / Fierce / DNSenum / AltDNS / ...
```

### Reverse Lookup Brute Force

If the PTR records, used for mail services, are configured for the domain,
reverse lookup brute force may possible.

If the DNS forward brute-force enumeration revealed a set of scattered IP
addresses, the following bash one liner can be used to conduct a reverse lookup
brute force:

```
for ip in $(seq <0> <255>);do host <x.x.x>.$ip;done |grep -v "not found"
```

### Public Resources and proprietary databases

Public resources such as Google, Bing, etc. and proprietary databases such as
DNSdumpster and VirusTotal, can contain FQDN.

The Sublist3r python script can be used to enumerate domains from public
resources sources, as well as doing subdomains brute forcing:

```
python sublist3r.py -d <DOMAIN>

python sublist3r.py -b <WORDLIST> -d <DOMAIN>
```
