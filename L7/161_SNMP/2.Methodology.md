# Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) - Methodology

### Network scan

`nmap` can be used to scan the network for exposed SNMP services:

```
nmap -v -sU -p 161,162 -sV -sC -oA nmap_snmp <RANGE | CIDR>
```

### SNMPv1 & SNMPv2c community strings bruteforce

Note: SNMP Community strings are used only by devices which support SNMPv1 and
SNMPv2c protocol. SNMPv3 uses username/password authentication, along with an
encryption key.
